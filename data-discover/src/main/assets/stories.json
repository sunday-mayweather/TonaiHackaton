    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [energetic music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are going to talk all about dopamine and what drives you to do the things that you do. We're going to talk about motivation and desire and craving, but also how dopamine relates to satisfaction and our feelings of wellbeing. And of course, any discussion about dopamine has to include a discussion about the potential for dopamine induced addiction. Indeed, dopamine lies at the heart of addiction to all things. But today we are mainly going to focus on, how what we do and how we do it, and how we conceptualize those things leads to changes in this amazing molecule in our brain and bodies that we call dopamine. I'm going to teach you what dopamine is and what it is not. There are a lot of myths about the molecule dopamine. We often hear about so-called dopamine hits. Today, we are going to dispel many common myths about dopamine, and we are going to talk about how dopamine actually works. We're going to discuss the biology of dopamine, the psychology. We will discuss some neural circuits and a really exciting aspect of dopamine biology or so-called dopamine schedules. In other words, we are going to discuss how things like food, drugs, caffeine, pornography, even some plant-based compounds can change our baseline levels of dopamine and in doing so, they change how much dopamine we are capable of experiencing from what could be very satisfying events, or events that make us feel not so good because of things that we did or took prior. So I promise you it's going to be a vast discussion, but I will structure it for you, and you'll come away with a deep understanding of really what drives you. You will also come away with a lot of tools, how to leverage dopamine so that you can sustain energy, drive and motivation for the things that are important to you over long periods of time. Before we dive into the meat of today's discussion, I'd like to share with you a fascinating result that really underscores what dopamine is capable of in our brains and bodies, and underscores the fact that just through behaviors, no drugs, nothing of that sort, just through behaviors, we can achieve terrifically high increases in dopamine that are very long and sustained in ways that serve us. This is a result that was published in the European Journal of Physiology. I'll go into it in more detail later, but essentially what it involved is having human subjects get into water of different temperatures. So it was warm water, moderately cool water and cold, cold water. Had them stay in that water for up to an hour, and they measured by way of blood draw things like cortisol, norepinephrine and dopamine. What was fascinating is that cold water exposure led to very rapid increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine, which is also just called adrenaline. It also led to increases in dopamine. And these increases in dopamine were very significant. They kicked in around 10 or 15 minutes after submersion into the cold water. And I should mention the head wasn't below water is just up to the neck. And the dopamine release continued to rise and rise and rise, and eventually reached 250% above baseline. Now, what was interesting is after subjects got out of this cold water, that dopamine increase was sustained. And I know nowadays many people are interested in using cold water therapy as a way to increase metabolism and fat loss, but also to improve sense of well-being, improve cognition, improve clarity of mind. There's something really special about this very alert, but calm state of mind that seems to be the one that's optimal for pretty much everything except sleep, but for all aspects of work and for social engagement and for sport that highly alert, but calm state of mind really is the sweet spot that I believe most of us would like to achieve. And this cold water exposure done correctly really can help people achieve that state of mind through these increases in dopamine that lasts a very long time. So I will later detail the specifics of that study, what it entailed in terms of how long, the variations, the different subjects experienced, as well as how to limit the amount of stress hormone, cortisol, that's released as a consequence of the cold water. And we will also talk about compounds, supplements that people can take in order to increase their levels of dopamine should they choose. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roka. Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system. And I can tell you that the visual system has to go through a lot of work in order to main clarity of what you see when there are shadows, when you go into different types of indoor lighting, and so on. And a lot of glasses don't work well because you put them on, and then you're in bright light and you can see fine, but then you move into a shadow and then you have to take them off and they don't adjust, or they don't adjust quickly enough. With Roka their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed with the visual system biology in mind. So you always see things with perfect clarity. The glasses are also terrific because they're very lightweight, and they won't slip off your face if you're exercising, if you're running or biking. In fact, they were designed for the purpose of being able to be worn while you're engaging in those sorts of activities or simply working at your desk. I happen to wear readers at night or when I drive or when I work, and I love their sunglasses cause I can wear them anywhere. And also the aesthetics of their sunglasses and eyeglasses are terrific. Unlike a lot of other performance glasses that frankly make people look like cyborgs. The aesthetics on Roka's are really terrific. You could wear them anywhere you'd like to go.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done. And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, you can also analyze your DNA to see what you ought to be doing for your immediate and long-term health. We hear a lot these days about optimization, optimizing hormones, optimizing your metabolism, optimizing this, optimizing that, but unless you know the measurements of metabolic factors, hormones and other things that are in your blood and DNA, you don't know what to optimize. With InsideTracker it makes all of that very easy. They can come to your house to take the blood and DNA test, or you can go to a nearby clinic. They send you the information and you take those results. And unlike a lot of laboratories doing blood work out there and DNA tests, they have a simple platform, a dashboard that walks you through your results and helps you identify what sorts of nutritional or behavioral or other types of practices you might want to incorporate into your life in order to positively impact your immediate and long-term health. It's a very easy system to use, and you will gain a ton of information simply by doing that test. Whether or not you end up making changes to what you're doing or not.

Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app backed by 25 published studies and has over 600,005 star reviews. I've been meditating for a long time, but I confess sometimes I meditate and sometimes I'm very inconsistent about my meditation. Ideally, I would meditate every day for 20 or 30 minutes, but what I found over the years is that, I'll start a meditation practice and then as life gets more stressful or busier, which is exactly when I need to meditate more, I tend to meditate less often. Switching over to Headspace as a meditation app really helped me stay consistent with my meditation practice. And that's because they have a huge range of meditations to select from. Some are short, some are longer. And in general, I try and get 20 minutes of meditation in every day, but some days it's just five minutes and they have some terrific just five minute meditations. The science says that even a five minute meditation can be beneficial for different aspects of our brain and body. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to www.headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get one month as a free trial with full library of meditations that you can use in any situation. This is the best deal offered by Headspace right now. So if you're interested, go to www.headspace.com/specialoffer to get one free one month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations. I'd like to announce that there's an event that some of you may find very useful. This is an event put on by Logitech that I will be speaking at. It's called Rethink Education, the Biology of Learning Reimagining Learning through Neuroscience. And at this event, I will be speaking, there will be other speakers as well, and I will be talking about neuroplasticity and its applications for teaching and for learning. I will describe what I call the plasticity super protocol that incorporates all of what we know about rapid learning, efficient learning and the best ways to teach and learn. It's geared towards educators of all kinds. It is zero cost. So please feel free to sign up. The event is September 30th, 2021 at 3:00 p.m Eastern. You can find the registration link in the caption for this episode. So let's talk about dopamine. Most people have heard of dopamine, and we hear all the time now about dopamine hits. But actually there's no such thing as a dopamine hit. And actually the way that your body uses dopamine is to have a baseline level of dopamine. Meaning an amount of dopamine that's circulating in your brain and body all the time. And that turns out to be important for how you feel generally, whether or not you're in a good mood, motivated, et cetera. And you also can experience peaks in dopamine above baseline. Now, this has a very specific name in the neurobiology literature, so-called tonic and phasic release of dopamine. And I'll explain what that means in a couple of minutes. But if you remember nothing else from this episode, please remember this, that when you experience something or you crave something really desirable, really exciting to you, very pleasurable. What happens afterwards is your baseline level of dopamine drops. Okay? So these peaks in dopamine, they influence how much dopamine will generally be circulating afterward. And you might think, oh, a big peak in dopamine after that, I'm going to feel even better because I just had this great event. Not the case. What actually happens is that your baseline level of dopamine drops. And I will explain the precise mechanism for that. Okay? In the neuroscience literature, we refer to this as tonic and phasic release of dopamine. Tonic being the low level baseline that's always there circulating, released into your brain all the time. And then phasic these peaks that ride above that baseline. And those two things interact. And this is really important. I'm going to teach you the underlying neurobiology, but even if you have no background in biology, I promise to make it all clear. I'll explain the terms and what they mean. And I'm excited to teach you about dopamine, because dopamine has everything to do with how you feel right now as you're listening to this, it has everything to do with how you will feel an hour from now, has everything to do with your level of motivation and your level of desire, and your willingness to push through effort. If ever you've interacted with somebody who just doesn't seem to have any drive they've given up, or if you've interacted with somebody who seems to have endless drive and energy, what you are looking at there in those two circumstances is without question a difference in the level of dopamine circulating in their system. There will be other factors too, but the level of dopamine is the primary determinant of how motivated we are, how excited we are, how outward facing we are and how willing we are, to lean into life and pursue things. Dopamine is what we call a neuromodulator. Neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are involved in the dialogue between neurons nerve cells. And neurotransmitters tend to mediate local communication. Just imagine two people talking to one another at a concert, that communication between them is analogous to the communication carried out by neurotransmitters, whereas neuromodulators influence the communication of many neurons. Imagine a bunch of people dancing where it's a coordinated dance involving 10 or 20 or hundreds of people. Neuromodulators are coordinating that dance. In the nervous system what this means is that, dopamine release changes the probability that certain neural circuits will be active and that other neural circuits will be inactive. Okay? So it modulates a bunch of things all at once, and that's why it's so powerful at shifting not just our levels of energy, but also our mindset, also our feelings of whether or not we can, or cannot accomplish something. So how does dopamine work and what does it do? Well, first of all, it is not just responsible for pleasure, it is responsible for motivation and drive. Primarily, at the psychological level, also for craving. Those three things are sort of the same. Motivation, drive and craving. It also controls time perception, and we will get deep into how dopamine can modulate time perception, and how important it is that everybody be able to access increases in dopamine at different timescales. This turns out to be important to not end up addicted to substances, but it also turns out to be very important to sustain effort and be a happy person over long periods of time. Which I think most everybody wants. It certainly is adaptive in life to be able to do that. Dopamine is also vitally important for movement. I'll explain the neural circuits for dopamine and mindset, and dopamine in movement in a moment, but in diseases like Parkinson's or Lewy bodies dementia, which is similar to Parkinson's in many ways. There's a depletion or death of dopamine neurons at a particular location in the brain which leads to shaky movements, challenges and speaking, challenges in particular in initiating movement. And because dopamine is depleted elsewhere to people with Parkinson's and Lew's bod, excuse me, Lewy body dementia also experience drops in motivation and affect, meaning mood. They tend to get depressed and so on. When those people are properly treated, they can, not always, but they can recover some fluidity of movement, some ability to initiate movement. And almost without question, those people feel better psychologically, not just because they can move, but also because dopamine impacts mood and motivation. So what are the underlying neural circuits? For those of you that are not interested in biology and specific nomenclature, you can tune out now if you want, but it's actually pretty straightforward. You have two main neural circuits in the brain that dopamine uses in order to exert all its effects. The first one is a pathway that goes from this area in the what's called the ventral tegmentum. That's a fancy, but ventral just means bottom, and tegmentum actually means floor. So it's at the bottom of the brain, and it's the ventral part of the floor. So it's really low in the back of the brain, the ventral tegmentum. And it goes from the ventral tegmentum to what's called the ventral striatum and the prefrontal cortex. Now, that's a lot of language, but basically what we call this is the, mesocorticolimbic pathway. This is the pathway by which dopamine influences motivation, drive and craving. It involves structures that some of you may have heard of before. Things like nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex. This is the pathway that really gets disrupted in addictions where in particular drugs that influence the release of dopamine like cocaine and methamphetamine. We'll talk about those drugs today. They tap into this pathway. But if you are pursuing a partner, a boyfriend or girlfriend, if you're pursuing a degree in school, if you're pursuing a finish line in a race, you are tapping into this so-called mesecorticolimbic pathway. This is the classic reward pathway in all mammals. The other pathway emerges from an area in the brain called the substantia nigra. So-called because the cells in that area are dark, and the substantia nigra connects to an area of the brain called the dorsal striatum. This is not surprisingly called the nigrostriatal pathway. For those of you who have never done any neuroanatomy, I'm going to teach you a little trick right now. Everything in neuroanatomy, the first part of a word tells you where the neurons are. And then the second part tells you where they are connecting to. So when I say nigropstriatal pathway, it means that the neurons are in substantial nigra and they connect to the striatum, nigrostriatal pathway. So while it's a lot of language there, some logic there. Okay? So we've got these two pathways. One, mainly for movement, right? This is the substantia nigra to dorsal striatum. And we've got this other pathway, the so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway, that's for reward, reinforcement and motivation. I want you to remember that there are two pathways. If you don't remember the two pathways in detail, that's fine. But please remember that there are two pathways, because that turns out to be important later. Now, the other thing to understand about dopamine is that, the way that dopamine is released in the brain and body can differ. Meaning it can be very local, or it can be more broad. Now, most of you have probably heard of synapses. Synapses are the little spaces between neurons, and basically neurons nerve cells communicate with one another by making each other electrically active, or by making each other less electrically active. So here's how this works. You can imagine one nerve cell and another nerve cell with a little gap between them, a little synapse. And the way that one nerve cell causes the next nerve cell to fire. What we call fire really means to become electrically active is that it vomits out these little packets, what we call vesicles. They're little bubbles filled with a chemical, when that chemical enters the synapse, it some of it docks or parks on the other side, in the other neuron. And by virtue of electrical changes in the, what we call the postsynaptic neuron, that chemical will make that neuron more electrically active or less electrically active. Dopamine can do that like any other neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. So it can have one neuron influence another neuron. But dopamine can also engage in what's called a volume metric release. Volumetric release is like a giant vomit that gets out to 50 or a hundred or even thousands of cells. So there's local release what we call synaptic release, and then there's volumetric release. So volumetric release is like dumping all this dopamine out into the system. So dopamine is incredible because it can change the way that our neural circuits work at a local scale and at a very broad scale. And for those of you that are only interested in tools, like how do I get more dopamine? Let me tell you this part is really important because if you were to take a drug or supplement that increases your level of dopamine, you are influencing both the local release of dopamine and volumetric release. This relates back to the baseline of dopamine and the big peak above baseline. And that turns out to be important. And I'll just allude to why it's important. Many drugs and indeed many supplements that increase dopamine will actually make it harder for you to sustain dopamine release over long periods of time. And to achieve those peaks that most of us are craving when we are in pursuit of things. Why? Because if you get both volume metric release, the dumping out of dopamine everywhere, and you're getting local release, what it means is that the difference between the peak and baseline is likely to be smaller. And this is very important, how satisfying or exciting or pleasureful a given experience is, doesn't just depend on the height of that peak, it depends on the height of that peak relative to the baseline. So if you increase the baseline and you increase the peak, you're not going to achieve more and more pleasure from things. I'll talk about how to leverage this information in a little bit, but just increasing your dopamine. Yes, it will make you excited for all things. It will make you feel very motivated, but it will also make that motivation very short-lived. So there's a better way to increase your dopamine. There's a better way to optimize this peak to baseline ratio. For now what we've talked about is two main neural circuits, one for movement, and one for motivation and craving with dopamine. And we've talked about two main modes of communication between neurons with dopamine. One is this local synaptic release. One is more volume metric release. And in the back of your mind, you can relate this back to, again, this baseline versus peaks above baseline. So that's a description of what we would call the spatial effects or the spatial aspects of dopamine. I said this connects to that, that connects to this. You can get local or more broad volumetric release. What about the duration of release or the duration of action for dopamine? Well, dopamine is unique among chemicals in the brain, because dopamine unlike a lot of chemicals in the brain works through what are called G protein-coupled receptors. And for those of you that are about to pass out from the amount of detail, just hang in there with me. It's really not complicated. There are two ways that neurons can communicate or mainly two ways. There are third and fourth, but mostly neurons communicate by two modes. One, are what we call fast electrical synapses ionotropic conduction. All right? You don't need to know what that means, but basically one neuron activates another neuron and little holes open up in that neuron, and ions rush in. Sodium is the main ion salt by which one neuron influences the electrical activity of another neuron because sodium ions contain a charge. Okay? There are other things like chloride and potassium. If you're interested in looking this up, just look up ionic conductances in the action potential, or I could do a post on it some time and we could go into detail. But just understand that when neurons want to influence each other, they can do it by way of this fast ionotropic conduction. This is a really quick way for one neuron to influence the next. Dopamine doesn't communicate that way. Dopamine is slower. It works through what are called G protein-coupled receptors. So what happens is dopamine is released in these little vesicles that I've mentioned before, get vomited out into the synapse. Some of that dopamine will bind to the so-called postsynaptic neuron, it'll bind to the next neuron, and then it sets off a cascade. It's kind of like a bucket brigade of one thing, getting handed off to the next, to the next, to the next. It's G protein-coupled receptors. And anytime you hear about these GPCRs or G protein-coupled receptors, pay attention because they're really interesting. They're slow, but they also can have multiple cascades of effects. They can impact even gene expression at some level. They can change what a cell actually becomes. They can change how well or how poorly that cell will respond to the same signal in the future. So dopamine works through the slower process. These G protein-coupled receptors. And so its effects tend to take a while in order to occur. This aspect of dopamine transmission is important because it now underscores two things. One, there's two pathways for dopamine to communicate. One for movement, one for motivation and craving. There's two spatial scales at which dopamine can operate synaptically or volumetrically. And dopamine can have slow effects, really slow effects, or even very long lasting effects. And it even can control gene expression. It can actually change the way that cells behave. One thing that's not often discussed about dopamine, but is extremely important to know is that dopamine doesn't work on its own. Neurons that release dopamine co-release glutamate. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter and it's a neurotransmitter that is excitatory, meaning it stimulates neurons to be electrically active. So now even if you don't know any cell biology, you should start to gain a picture that dopamine is responsible for movement, motivation and drive. It does that through two pathways, but also the dopamine stimulates action in general, because it releases this excitatory neurotransmitter. It tends to make certain neurons that are nearby or even that are far away, because of volumetric release, it tends to make those more active. So dopamine is really stimulating. And indeed we say that dopaminergic transmission or dopamine tends to stimulate sympathetic arousal. Sympathetic doesn't have anything to do with sympathy. It's just simply means that it tends to increase our levels of alertness. It tends to bring an animal or a human into a state of more alertness, readiness and desire to pursue things outside the confines of its skin. So if I were to just put a really simple message around dopamine it would be, there's a molecule in your brain and body that when released tends to make you look outside yourself, pursue things outside yourself, and to crave things outside yourself. The pleasure that arrives from achieving things also involves dopamine, but is mainly the consequences of other molecules. But if ever you felt lethargic and like just lazy and you had no motivation or drive, that's a low dopamine state. If ever you felt really excited, motivated, even if you're a little scared to do something. Maybe you did your first skydive, or you're about to do your first skydive, or you're about to do some public speaking and you really don't want to screw it up, you are in a high dopamine state. Dopamine is a universal currency in all mammals, but especially in humans for moving us toward goals and how much dopamine is in our system at any one time compared to how much dopamine was in our system a few minutes ago, and how much we remember enjoying a particular experience of the past. That dictates your so-called quality of life and your desire to pursue things. This is really important. Dopamine is a currency, and it's the way that you track pleasure. It's the way that you track success. It's the way that you track whether or not you are doing well or doing poorly. And that is subjective, but if your dopamine is too low, you will not feel motivated. If your dopamine is really high, you will feel motivated. And if your dopamine is somewhere in the middle, how you feel depends on whether or not you had higher dopamine a few minutes ago or lower dopamine. This is important, your experience of life and your level of motivation and drive depends on how much dopamine you have relative to your recent experience. This is again, something that's just not accounted for in the simple language of dopamine hits. Okay? A simple way to envision dopamine hits is every time you do something you like, you to piece of chocolate, dopamine hit. You look at your Instagram, dopamine hit. You see someone you like, dopamine hit. All these things described as dopamine hits neglect the fact that if you scroll social media and you see something you really like, dopamine hit. Sure there's an increase in dopamine, but then you get to something else and you go, hmm, not that interesting. However, had you arrived at that second thing first, you might think that it was really interesting. If you had arrived to that second Instagram post three days later or four days later, you might find it extremely interesting. Again, how much dopamine you experience from something depends on your baseline level of dopamine when you arrive there, and your previous dopamine peaks. Okay? That's super important to understand, and it's completely neglected by the general language of dopamine hits. This is why when you repeatedly engage in something that you enjoy, your threshold for enjoyment goes up and up and up. So I want to talk about that process. And I want to explain how that process works, because if you understand that process, and you understand some of these schedules and kinetics as we call them around dopamine, you will be in a terrific position to use any dopamine enhancing tools that you decide to use. You'll be in an excellent position to modulate and control your own dopamine release for optimal motivation and drive. I realized that was a lot of information about the biology of dopamine, sort of like trying to make you drink from the fire hose of dopamine biology. However, I realized that some people probably want even more information about the biology of dopamine transmission. If you're interested in that, I'll post a link to a absolutely stellar review that was published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience called spatial and temporal scales of dopamine transmission. It is quite detailed, but they have beautiful diagrams and can walk you through all the things that I just described and get into even more detail. We'll put a link to that in the caption on YouTube. Right now, I want to share with you two anecdotes, one from my own life, and one from some fairly recent history that illustrate some of the core biology of dopamine and how profoundly it can shape our experience. The first one is a really tragic situation that occurred. This was in the 80s, there was a outbreak of what looked like Parkinsonian symptoms in a young population. So many of you heard of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a disease in which people initially start to quake, can't generate smooth movements, they'll have issues with speech, sometimes cognition as well. There are examples like Michael J. Fox, which are kind of early onset. Parkinson's typically it hits people a little bit later in life. There's a genetic component. But there is this question, and there's always been this question whether or not certain lifestyle factors can also create Parkinson's? And some years ago there was a situation where street laboratories, illicit laboratories were trying to make a drug called MPPP, which is an opioid light compound. It's a bit like heroin, and heroin addicts seeking heroin went out and bought what they thought was MPPP. Unfortunately, it was not MPPP. I mean, it would have been tragic if it was anyway because they were drug addicts, but what they ended up taking turned out to be a lot worse. What they ended up taking was MPTP, and MPTP can arise in the synthesis of MPPP. So someone in a lab someplace, this was mainly in the Central Valley in California, but elsewhere as well. Somebody created MPTP, and what ended up happening was a large number of young people who were opioid addicts became completely boxed in paralyzed. Couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't do anything. Couldn't function, couldn't move. So both aspects of dopamine transmission were disrupted. They had no motivation and drive. They couldn't generate any movement of any kind. They were literally locked in frozen. And sadly, this is irreversible. It's irreversible, because what MPTP does is it kills the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra that nigrostriatal pathway that's involved in generating movement. And it kills the dopaminergic neurons of the so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway. I was in college when this whole MPTP thing happened. And I remember hearing this story. At the time, I had no understanding of what it is to have very high levels of dopamine or extremely depleted levels of dopamine. There was no reason why I should have that understanding. I mean, of course I had experienced different pleasures of different kinds and I've had lows in my life, but nothing to the extreme that I'm about to discuss. I got Giardia. And Giardia is a stomach bug that if any of you ever had it, it is terrible. It's terrible diarrhea. You end up very dehydrated very quickly. You drop a ton of weight and it is extremely unpleasant. I ended up going to the emergency room, and in the emergency room, I begged them for something to stop up my guts. And they gave it to me. They put a saline line into rehydrate me and they injected something into the saline bag. And within minutes I felt more sadness, more overwhelming sense of depression, basically, lower than I'd ever felt in my entire life. It was absolutely profound. I was crying endlessly without knowing why I was crying. I was miserable. And I asked them, what did you inject? And they said, \"We injected Thorazine.\" Thorazine is an antipsychotic drug. It's actually used to block dopamine receptors. It's what's given to people who have schizophrenia. Often is given to people who have schizophrenia, because schizophrenia involves among other things elevated levels of dopamine. It was horrible. The experience of it was miserable, unlike anything I'd ever experienced. And so I actually said to them, \"What did you give me?\" They said, \"Thorazine.\" And I said, \"You have to give me l-DOPA. \"You have to give me something to get my dopamine levels \"back up again.\" And they did. They gave me an injection of l-DOPA into the bag, went straight to my bloodstream. And within minutes I felt fine again. It was incredible. And it really opened up my mind and my experience to what it is to have absolutely plummeted levels of dopamine. And there's nothing more miserable than that I'll tell you. And these poor souls who had this MPTP experience, unfortunately, they couldn't recover those cells. People who have severe Parkinson's are struggling with this as well, because in Parkinson's and in Lewy body dementia, the dopaminergic neurons often die. It's not just a problem with those neurons releasing enough dopamine. Later, we're going to talk about some approaches to maintaining dopaminergic neuron health and things that we can all do for that. But I will tell you these dopamine neurons that we all have are very precious for movement and mood and motivation. Having experienced what it is to have very, very low levels of dopamine or in this case to have my dopamine receptors blocked from Thorazine was eye-opening to say the least, and has given me tremendous sensitivity to the fact that dopamine is perhaps one of the most powerful molecules that any of us has inside of us. And the one that we ought to all think very carefully about how we leverage, because while most experiences and most things that we do, and take and eat and cetera, won't create enormous highs and enormous lows in dopamine. Even subtle fluctuations in dopamine really shape our perception of life and what we're capable of, and how we feel. And so we want to guard those and we want to understand them. So let's lean into that understanding about dopamine. And then let's talk about some tools that we can all use to leverage dopamine in order to keep that baseline in the appropriate, healthy place, and still be able to access those peaks in dopamine. Because those, after all are some of what makes life rich and worth living. So let's talk about the baseline of dopamine that we all have and the peaks in dopamine that we all can achieve through different activities and things that we ingest. All of us have different baseline levels of dopamine. Some of this is sure to be genetic. Some people just simply ride at a level a little bit higher. They're a little bit more excited, they're a little bit more motivated, or maybe they're a lot more excited or a lot more motivated. Some people are a little mellower, some people are a little less excitable. And some of that has to do with the fact that dopamine doesn't act alone. Dopamine has close cousins or friends in the nervous system. And I'll just name off a few of those close cousins and friends. Epinephrin also called adrenaline is the main chemical driver of energy. We can't do anything, anything at all, unless we have some level of epinephrin in our brain and body. It's released from the adrenal glands which right on top our kidneys. It's released from an area of the brainstem called locus coeruleus. And its release tends to wake up neural circuits in the brain and wake up various aspects of our body's physiology and give us a readiness. So it should come as no surprise that dopamine and epinephrin aka adrenaline hang out together. In fact, epinephrin and adrenaline are actually manufactured from dopamine. There's a biochemical pathway involving dopamine which is a beautiful pathway. If ever you want to look it up, you can just look up biochemistry of dopamine. But what you'll find is that, l-DOPA is converted into dopamine. Dopamine is converted to two noradrenaline. Norepinephrin, it's also called. And noredrenaline, norepinephrin is converted into adrenaline. So not only are dopamine and epinephrin aka adrenaline close cousins, they are actually family members. Okay? They're closely related. I'm not going to get too deep into epinephrin today. I'm not going to talk too much about those pathways, but anytime I'm talking about dopaminergic transmission or that you have a peak in dopamine, inevitably, that means that you have a peak and release of epinephrin as well. What dopamine does is dopamine really colors the subjective experience of an activity to make it more pleasureful, to make it something that you want more of. Epinephrin is more about energy. Epinephrin alone can be fear, paralysis, trauma. Not physical paralysis, but mental paralysis, you know, frozen in fear or being traumatized or scared. But the addition of dopamine to that chemical cocktail, if dopamine is released in the brain, well, then that epinephrin becomes one of excitement. Okay? I'm using a broad brush here, but essentially what you need to know is that, dopamine and epinephrin aka adrenaline are family members. And they tend to work together like a little gang to make you seek out certain things. So what sorts of activities? What sorts of things increase dopamine? And how much do they increase dopamine? Well, let's take a look at some typical things that people do out there or ingest out there that are known to increase dopamine. So let's recall that you have a baseline level of dopamine and that everybody does. And even within a family, you might have family members who are very excitable, happy and motivated, and others who are less excitable, happy and motivated. But your level of dopamine has everything to do with those genetics, but also with what you've experienced in the previous days and the previous months and so on. When you do or ingest certain things, your levels of dopamine will rise above baseline transiently. And depending on what you do or ingest, it will rise either more or less, and it will be very brief or a last a long time. So let's take a look at some of the typical things that people take and do and eat. Some are good for us, some are not good for us. And let's ask how much dopamine is increased above baseline? Now, of course, these are averages, but these are averages that have been measured in so-called micro dialysis studies in animals. So actually extracting from particular brain areas how much dopamine is released? Or from measuring the serum, the circulating levels of dopamine in humans. Chocolate. They didn't look at milk versus dark chocolate. But chocolate will increase your baseline level of dopamine 1.5 times. Okay? So it's a pretty substantial increase in dopamine. It's transient. It goes away after a few minutes or even a few seconds. I'll explain what determines the duration in a minute. But 1.5 times for chocolate. Sex. Both the pursuit of sex and the act of sex increases dopamine two times. So it's a doubling above baseline. Now, of course, there's going to be variation there, but that's the average increase in baseline dopamine caused by sex. Later, I will talk about how the different aspects of the so-called arousal art, the different aspects of sex, believe it or not have a differential impact on dopamine. But for now as a general theme or activity, sex doubles the amount of dopamine circulating in your blood. Nicotine. In particular, nicotine that is smoked like cigarettes and so forth, increases dopamine two and a half times above baseline. So there's a peak that goes up above baseline two and a half times higher. It is very short-lived. Anyone who's ever been a chain smoker or observed a chain smoker understands that the increase in dopamine from nicotine is very short-lived. Cocaine will increase the level of dopamine in the bloodstream two and a half times above baseline. And amphetamine another drug that increases dopamine will increase the amount of dopamine in the bloodstream 10 times above baseline. A tremendous increase in dopamine. Exercise. Now, exercise will have a different impact on the levels of dopamine, depending on how much somebody subjectively enjoys that exercise. So if you're somebody who loves running, chances are it's going to increase your levels of dopamine two times above your baseline, not unlike sex. People who dislike exercise will achieve less dopamine increase or no increase in dopamine from exercise. And if you like other forms of exercise like yoga or weightlifting or swimming or what have you. Again, it's going to vary by your subjective experience of whether or not you enjoy that activity. This is important. And it brings us back to something that we talked about earlier. Remember that mesocorticolimbic pathway? Well, the cortical part is important. The cortical part actually has a very specific part, which is your prefrontal cortex. The area of your forebrain that's involved in thinking and planning and involved in assigning a rational explanation to something, and involved in assigning a subjective experience to something, right? So for instance, the pen that I'm holding right now, it's one of these Pilot V5s. I love these Pilot V5s. They don't sponsor the podcast. I just happen to like them. I liked the way that they write, how they feel. If I spent enough time thinking about it, or talking about it, I could probably get a dopamine increase just talking about this Pilot V5. And that's not because I have the propensity to release dopamine easily, it's that as we start to engage with something more and more and what we say about it, and what we encourage ourselves to think about it, has a profound impact on its rewarding or non rewarding properties. Now, it's not simply the case that you can lie to yourself, and you can tell yourself I love something and when you don't really love it, and it will increase dopamine. But what's been found over and over again, is that if people journal about something or they practice some form of appreciation for something, or they think of some aspect of something that they enjoy, the amount of dopamine that that behavior will evoke tends to go up. So for people that hate exercise, you can think about some aspect of exercise that you really enjoy. However, I will caution you against saying to yourself, I hate exercise or I hate studying or I hate this person, but I love the reward I give myself afterward. Later, we're going to talk about how rewards given afterward actually make the situation worse. They won't make you like exercise more or study more, they actually will undermine the dopamine release that would otherwise occur for that activity. So certain things chemicals have a universal effect. They make everybody's dopamine go up. So some people like chocolate, some people don't of course, but in general, it make has causes this increase in dopamine. But sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine, those things cause increases in dopamine and everybody that takes them. Things like exercise, studying, hard work, working through a challenge in a relationship or working through something hard of any kind that is going to be subjective as to how much dopamine will be released. And we will return to that subjective component in a little bit. But now you have a sense of how much dopamine can be evoked by different activities and by different substances. One that you might be wondering about is caffeine. I'm certainly drinking my caffeine today, and I do enjoy caffeine in limited quantities. I drink yerba mate and I drink coffee and I love it. Does it increase dopamine? Well, a little bit. Caffeine will increase dopamine to some extent, but it is pretty modest compared to the other things that I described. Chocolate, sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine and so on. However, there's a really interesting paper published in 2015. This is Volkow et al. You can look up it's very easy to find. That showed that regular ingestion of caffeine, whether or not it's from coffee or otherwise, increases up regulation of certain dopamine receptors. So caffeine actually makes you able to experience more of dopamines effects. Because as I mentioned before, dopamine is vomited out into the synapse or it's released volumetrically, but then it has to bind someplace and trigger those G protein-coupled receptors. And caffeine increases the number, the density of those G protein-coupled receptors. Now, sitting back and thinking about that, you might think, oh yeah, you know, sometimes I'll notice people, at least in the old days that used to be a cigarette and a cup of coffee. Or when people drink alcohol, oftentimes they'll smoke. And it's well-known that different compounds like alcohol and nicotine or caffeine and nicotine or certain behaviors and certain drugs can synergize to give bigger dopamine increases. And this is not terribly uncommon. There are a lot of people nowadays who for instance take pre-workout energy drinks. They'll drink, I won't name names, but they'll drink a canned energy drink or they'll drink a pre-workout and they'll try and get that big stimulation that stimulant effect for the dopamine, the norepinephrin, that family of molecules that works together to make you motivated. And then they'll also exercise to try and get even more of a dopaminergic experience out of that workout. Sometimes it's also to perform better as well, of course, but as we'll talk about in a few minutes, that aspect or that approach rather of trying to just get your dopamine as high as you possibly can, in order to get the most out of experience, turns out to not be the best approach. And what you'll find as we talk about dopamine schedules is that layering together multiple things, substances and activities that lead to big increases in dopamine, actually can create pretty severe issues with motivation and energy right after those experiences and even a couple of days later. So I'm not saying that people shouldn't take the occasional pre-workout if that's your thing, or drink a cup of coffee or two before working out now and again. Some people really enjoy that. I certainly do that every once in a while, but if you do it too often, what you'll find is that your capacity to release dopamine and your level of motivation and drive and energy overall will take a serious hit. Now, I've been alluding to this dopamine peaks versus dopamine baseline things since the beginning of the episode. I talked about tonic and phasic release and so forth. But now let's really drill into what this means, and how to leverage it for our own purposes. In order to do that, let's take a step back and ask, why would we have a dopamine system like this? Why would we have a dopamine system at all? Well, we have to remember what our species primary interest is? Our species like all species has a main interest, and that's to make more of itself. And it's just about sex and reproduction. It's about forging for resources. Resources can be food, it can be water can be salt, it can be shelter, it can be social connection. Dopamine is the universal currency of forging and seeking, right? We call sometimes talk about motivation and craving, but what we mean in the evolutionary adaptive context, what we mean is forging and seeking. Seeking water, seeking food, seeking mates. Seeking things that make us feel good and avoiding things that don't make us feel good. But in particular seeking things that will provide sustenance and pleasure in the short-term and will extend the species in the long-term. Once we understand that dopamine is a driver for us to seek things, it makes perfect sense as to why it would have a baseline level and it would have peaks. And that the baseline and peaks would be related in some sort of direct way. Here's what I mean by that. Let's say that you were not alive now, but you were alive 10,000 years ago. And you woke up and you looked and you realized you had minimal water and you had minimal food left. Maybe you have a child, maybe you have a partner, maybe you're in an entire village, but you realize that you need things. Okay? You need to be able to generate the energy to go seek those things. And chances are there were dangers in seeking those things. Yes, it could be saber-tooth tigers and things of that sort, but there are other dangers too. There's the danger of a cut to your skin that could lead to infection. There's the danger of storms, there's the danger of cold, there's the danger of leaving your loved ones behind. So you go out and forage, right? You could be hunting, you could be gathering, or you could be doing both. The going out and foraging process was we are certain driven by dopamine. I mean, there's no fossil record of the brain, but the circuits have existed. We know for tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years. And they are present in every animal, not just mammals, but even in little worms like C. elegans, it's the same process. It's mediated by dopamine. So dopamine drives you to go out and look for things. And then let's say you find a couple berries, and these ones are rotten, these ones are good. Maybe you hunt an animal and kill it, or you find an animal that was recently killed and you decide to take the meat. You are going to achieve, or I should say, experience some sort of dopamine release. You found the reward. That's great. But then it needs to return to some lower level. Why? Well, because if you just stayed there, you would never continue to forage for more. It doesn't just increase your baseline and then stay there. It goes back down. And what's very important to understand is that it doesn't just go back down to the level it was before, it goes down to a level below what it was before you went out seeking that thing. Now, this is counter-intuitive. We often think, Oh, okay, I'm going to pursue the win, right? Let's move this to modern day. I'm going to run this marathon, I'm going to train for this marathon. Then you run the marathon and you finish, you cross the finish line, you feel great. And you would think, okay, now I'm set for the entire year, I'm going to feel so much better, I'm going to feel this accomplishment in my body, it's going to be so great. That's not what happens. You might feel some of those things, but your level of dopamine has actually dropped below baseline. Now, eventually it will ratchet back up. But two things are really important. First of all, the extent to which it drops below baseline is proportional to how high the peak was. So if you cross the finish line pretty happy, it won't drop that much below baseline afterward. If you cross the finish line ecstatic, well, a day or two later, you're going to feel quite a bit lower than you would otherwise. You might not be depressed, because it depends on where that baseline was to begin with. But the so-called postpartum depression that people experience after giving birth or after some big win a graduation or any kind of celebration that postpartum drop in mood and affect and motivation is the drop in baseline dopamine. This is very important to understand, because this happens on very rapid timescales and it can last quite a long time. It also explains the behavior that most of us are familiar with, of engaging in something that we really enjoy. Going to a restaurant that we absolutely love, or engaging in some way with some person that we really, really enjoy. But if we continue to engage in that behavior over and over again, it kind of loses its edge. It starts to kind of feel less exciting to us. Some of us experienced that drop in excitement more quickly and more severely than others, but everyone experiences that to some extent. And this has direct roots in these evolutionarily conserved circuits. Some of you may be hearing this and think, no, no, no, no that's not how it works for me. I'm just riding higher and higher all the time. I love my kids, I love my job, I love school, I love wins, I don't want losses. I agree. We all feel good when we are achieving things, but oftentimes we are feeling good because we are layering in different aspects of life, consuming things and doing things that increase our dopamine. We're getting those peaks, but afterward the drop in baseline occurs, and it always takes a little while to get back to our stable baseline. We really all have a sort of dopamine set point. And if we continue to indulge in the same behaviors or even different behaviors that increase our dopamine in these big peaks over and over and over again, we won't experience the same level of joy from those behaviors or from anything at all. Now, that has a name. It's called addiction. But even for people who aren't addicted, even for people don't an attachment to any specific substance or behavior, this drop in bay below baseline after any peak in dopamine is substantial. And it governs whether or not we are going to feel motivated to continue to pursue other things. Fortunately, there's a way to work with this, such that we can constantly stay motivated, but also keep that baseline of dopamine at an appropriate, healthy level. A previous guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast was Dr. Anna Lembke. She's head of the Addiction Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford. Has this amazing book, \"Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence\". If you haven't read the book, I highly encourage you to check it out. It's fantastic. The other terrific book about dopamine is the \"Molecule of More\", which is a similar in some regard, but isn't so much about addiction, it's more about other types of behaviors. Both books really focus on these dopamine schedules and the relationship between these peaks and baselines of dopamine. In Dr. Lembke's book, and when she was on the Huberman Lab Podcast and other podcasts, she's talked about this pleasure pain balance that when we seek something that we really like, or we indulge in it, like eating a little piece of chocolate, if we really liked chocolate, there's some pleasure. But then there's a little bit of pain that exceeds the amount of pleasure, and it's subtle, and we experience it as wanting more of that thing. Okay? So there's a pleasure pain balance, and I'm telling you that the pleasure and the pain are governed by dopamine to some extent. Well, how could that be? Right? I said before, when you engage in an activity or when you ingest something that increases dopamine, the dopamine levels go up, you know, to substantial degree with all the things I listed off. Where's the pain coming from? Well, the pain is coming from the lack of dopamine that follows. And you now know what that lack of dopamine reflects. How do you know? Well, earlier we were talking about how dopamine is released between neurons. And I mentioned two ways. One, is into the synapse where it can activate the postsynaptic neuron. And the other was what I called volumetric release where it is distributed more broadly. It's released out over a bunch of neurons. In both cases it's released from these things we call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles, tiny, tiny little bubbles that contain dopamine. Prrr! They get vomited out into the area or into the synapse. Well, those vesicles get depleted. For the synaptic physiologists out there, we call this the readily releasable pool of dopamine. We can only deploy dopamine that is ready to be deployed. That's packaged in those little vesicles and ready to go. It's like when you order a product and they say out of stock until two months from now. Well, it's not ready to be released. Same thing with dopamine. There's a pool of dopamine that synthesized, and you can only release the dopamine that's been synthesized. It's the readily releasable pool. The pleasure pain balance doesn't only hinge on the readily releasable pool of dopamine, but a big part of the pleasure pain balance hinges on how much dopamine is there? And how much is ready and capable of being released into the system? So now we've given some meat to this thing that we call the pleasure pain balance, and now it should make perfect sense why if you take something or do something that leads to huge increases in dopamine, afterward your baseline should drop because there isn't a lot of dopamine around to keep your baseline going. Fortunately, most people do not experience or pursue enormous increases in dopamine leading to the severe drops in baseline. Many people do, however, and that's what we call addiction. When somebody pursues a drug or an activity that leads to huge increases in dopamine. And now you understand that afterward the baseline of dopamine drops because of depletion of dopamine, that readily releasable pool. The dopamine is literally not around to be released, and so people feel pretty lousy and many people make the mistake of then going and pursuing the dopamine evoking the dopamine releasing activity or substance again thinking mistakenly that it's going to bring up their baseline. It's going to give them that peak again. Not only does it not give them a peak, their baseline gets lower and lower because they're depleting dopamine more and more and more. And we've seen this over and over again when people get addicted to something then they're not achieving much pleasure at all. You can even see this with video games. People will play a video game, they love it, it's super exciting to them, and then they'll keep playing and playing and playing, and either one of two things happens typically both. First of all, I always say addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. So oftentimes what will happen is the person only has excitement and can achieve dopamine release to the same extent doing that behavior and not other behaviors. And so they start losing interest in school, they start losing interest in relationships. they start losing interest in fitness and wellbeing and depletes their life. And eventually what typically happens is, they will stop getting dopamine release from that activity as well, and then they drop into a pretty serious depression and this can get very severe and people have committed suicide from these sorts of patterns of activity. But what about the more typical scenario? What about the scenario of somebody who is really good at working during the week, they exercise during the week, they drink on the weekends? Well, that person is only consuming alcohol maybe one or two nights a week, but oftentimes that same person will be spiking their dopamine with food during the middle of the week. Now, we all have to eat and it's nice to eat foods that we enjoy. I certainly do that. I love food in fact. But let's say they're eating foods that really evoke a lot of dopamine release in the middle of the week, they're drinking one or two days on the weekend, they are one of these work, hard play hard type. So they're swimming a couple miles in the ocean in the middle of the week as well. They're going out dancing once on the weekend. Sounds like a pretty balanced life as I describe it. Well, here's the problem. The problem is that dopamine is not just evoked by one of these activities, dopamine is evoked by all of these activities. And dopamine is one currency of craving motivation and desire and pleasure. There's only one currency. So even though if you look at the activities, you'd say, well, it's just on the weekends so this thing is only a couple of times a week. If you looked at dopamine simply as a function, as a chemical function of peaks and baseline, it might make sense why this person after several years of work hard, play hard would say, yeah, you know I'm feeling kind of burnt out. I'm just not feeling like I have the same energy that I did a few years ago. And of course there are age-related reasons why people can experience drops in energy, but oftentimes what's happening is not some sort of depletion and cellar metabolism that's related to aging. What's happening is they're spiking their dopamine through so many different activities throughout the week, that their baseline is progressively dropping. And in this case it can be very subtle. It can be very, very subtle. And that's actually a very sinister function of dopamine we could say. Which is that it can often drop in imperceptible ways, but then at once it reaches a threshold of low dopamine, we just feel like, hmm, we can't really get pleasure from anything anymore. What used to work doesn't work anymore. So it starts to look a lot like the more severe addictions or the more acute addictions to things like cocaine and amphetamine which lead to these big increases, these big spikes in dopamine, and then these very severe drops in the baseline. Now, of course, we all should engage in activities that we enjoy. I certainly do, everybody should. A huge part of life is pursuing activities and things that we enjoy. The key thing is to understand this relationship between the peaks and the baseline, and to understand how they influence one another. Because once you do that, you can start to make really good choices in the short run and in the long run to maintain your level of dopamine baseline. Maybe even raise that level of dopamine baseline and still get those peaks and still achieve those feelings of elevated motivation, elevated desire and craving. Because again, those peaks and having a sufficiently healthy high level of dopamine baseline are what drove the evolution of our species, and they're really what drive the evolution of anyone's life progression too. So they're a good thing. Dopamine is a good thing. Just very briefly, because it was also covered in the interview episode I did with Anna Lembke about addiction. Some of you might be asking, what should I do if I experience a drop in my baseline level of dopamine because of engagement with some activity or some substance that led to big peaks? Just to put some color and example on this, a few episodes ago I talked about a friend who I've known a long time. So it actually the child of a friend who has basically become addicted to video games, he decided actually after seeing that episode with Anna to do a 30-day complete fast from phone, from video games and from social media of all kinds. He's now at day 29 has really accomplished this, not incidentally, his levels of concentration, his overall mood are up. He's doing far far better. What he did is hard. In particular first 14 days is really hard, but the way that you replenish the releasable pool of dopamine is to not engage in these dopaminergic seeking behaviors. Because remember typically people arrive at a place where they want to stop engaging in these behaviors or ingesting substances when that dopamine is depleted, when they're not getting the same lift. In his case, he was feeling depressed. He thought he had ADHD. They were starting to treat it as ADHD. And certainly there are people out there who have ADHD, but what he found was that his levels of concentration are back. He does not need to be treated for ADHD. And actually the psychiatrist wondered if he did prior to this video game, social media fast. He's feeling good. He's exercising again. I'm not making this up. This is really a very specific, but very relevant example of how the dopamine system can replenish itself. Of course, if there's a clinical need for ADHD treatment, by all means pursue that. But I think a lot of ADHD does go misdiagnosed because of this depletion in dopamine that occurs because of overindulgence in other activities in the drop in baseline. So for anyone that's experienced a real drop in baseline who has addictive tendencies, whether or not their behaviors or substances, that is always going to be the path forward. Is going to be either cold turkey or through some sort of tapering to limit interactions with the, what would otherwise be the dopamine evoking behavior or substance. So let's talk about the optimal way to engage in activities or to consume things that evoke dopamine. And by no means am I encouraging people to take drugs of abuse. I would not do that, I am not doing that. But some of the things on these lists of dopamine evoking activities are things like chocolate, coffee, even if it's indirect. Sex and reproduction, provided it's healthy consensual context appropriate, age appropriate, species appropriate of course, is central to our evolution and progression as a species. So certain things like cocaine, amphetamine, I will put in the classification of bad. I'm willing to do that. And other things are part of life, food, exercise if that evokes your dopamine. How are we supposed to engage with these dopamine evoking activities in ways that are healthy and beneficial for us? How do we achieve these peaks, which are so central to our wellbeing and experience of life without dropping our baseline? And the key lies in intermittent release of dopamine. The real key is to not expect or chase high levels of dopamine release every time we engage in these activities. Intermittent reward schedules are the central schedule by which casinos keep you gambling. The central schedule by which elusive partners or potential partners keep you texting and pursuing on either side of the relationship. Intermittent schedules are the way that the internet and social media and all highly engaging activities keep you motivated and pursuing. And we can take this back to our evolutionary adaptive scenario where you are out there looking for water, looking for food, not every trail, not every pursuit, not every hunch about where the animals will be? Where the food will be? Where the berries will be? Not every single one of those played out. There's something called dopamine reward prediction error. When we expect something to happen, we are highly motivated to pursue it. If it happens great, we get the reward. The reward comes in various chemical forms including dopamine, and we are more likely to engage in that behavior again. This is the basis of casino gambling. This is how they keep you going back again and again and again, even though on average the house really does win. You can transplant that example to any number of different pleasureful activities. If you're not a gambler and that doesn't appeal to you, I have to imagine there's something that appeals to you, something that you do repeatedly because you enjoy it. And almost inevitably it's because there's an intermittent schedule. There's a intermittent schedule by which dopamine sometimes arrives, sometimes a little bit, sometimes a lot, sometimes a medium amount. Okay? That intermittent reinforcement schedule is actually the best schedule to export to other activities. How do you do that? Well, first of all, if you are engaged in activities school, sport, relationship, et cetera, where you experience a win, you should be very careful about allowing yourself to experience huge peaks in dopamine, unless you're willing to suffer the crash that follows and waiting a period of time for it to come back up. What would this look like in the practical sense? Well, let's say you are somebody who really does enjoy exercise, or let's say you're somebody who kind of likes exercise, but forces yourself to do it, but you make it pleasureful by giving yourself your favorite cup of coffee first, or maybe taking a pre-workout drink or taking an energy drink or listening to your favorite music. And then you're in the gym and you're listening to your music. That all sounds great, right? Well, it is great except that by layering together all these things to try and achieve that dopamine release, and by getting a big peak in dopamine, you're actually increasing the number of conditions required to achieve pleasure from that activity again. And so there is a form of this where sometimes you do all the things that you love to get the optimal workout. You listen to your favorite music, you got your favorite time of day, you have your pre-workout drink, if that's your thing. You do all the things that give you that best experience of the workout for you. But there's also a version of this where sometimes you don't do the dopamine enhancing activities. You don't ingest anything to increase your dopamine. You just do the exercise. You don't do the exercise and expect dopamine to arrive through some what we call exogenous source as well. You might think, well, that sounds lame. I want to continue to enjoy exercising. Ah, well, that's exactly the point. If you want to maintain motivation for school, exercise, relationships or pursuits of any duration in kind, the key thing is to make sure that the peak in dopamine, if it's very high, doesn't occur too often. And if something does occur very often that you vary how much dopamine you experience with each engagement in that activity. Now, some activities naturally have this intermittent property woven into them, right? We sometimes have classes that we like and other classes we don't like. We don't always get straight A's, sometimes we don't get rewarded with the outcome that we would like. We don't always have the perfect relationship outcome, but understand that your ability to experience motivation and pleasure for what comes next is dictated by how much motivation and pleasure and dopamine you experienced prior. The reason I can't give a very specific protocol like delete dopamine or lower dopamine every third time, is that that wouldn't be intermittent. The whole basis of intermittent reinforcement is that you don't really have a specific schedule of when dopamine is going to be high, and when dopamine is going to be low and when dopamine is going to be medium. That's a predictable schedule, not a random intermittent schedule. So do like the casinos do certainly works for them and for activities that you would like to continue to engage in over time, whatever those happen to be. Start paying attention to the amount of dopamine and excitement and pleasure that you achieve with those, and start modulating that somewhat at random. That might be removing some of the dopamine releasing chemicals that you might take prior. Maybe you remove them every time, but then every once in a while you introduce them,. Maybe it involves sometimes doing things socially that you enjoy doing socially, sometimes doing the same thing, but alone. There are a lot of different ways to do this. There are a lot of different ways to approach this, but now knowing what you know about peaks and baselines in dopamine and understanding how important it is not just to achieve peaks, but to maintain that baseline at a healthy level, it should be straightforward for you to implement these intermittent schedules. For those of you that are begging for more specificity, we can give you a tool. One would be, you can flip a coin before engaging in any of these types of activities and decide whether or not you are going to allow other dopamine supportive elements to go for instance, into the gym with you. Are you going to listen to music or not? If you enjoy listening to music, well then flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, bring the music in, if it comes up tails, don't. Okay? It sounds like you're undercutting your own progress, but actually you are serving your own progress both short-term and long-term by doing that. Now, the smartphone is a very interesting tool for dopamine in light of all this. It's extremely common nowadays to see people texting and doing selfies and communicating in various ways, listening to podcasts, listening to music, doing all sorts of things while they engage in other activities or going to dinner and texting other people or making plans, sharing information. That's all wonderful, it gives depth and richness and color to life, but it isn't just about our distracted nature when we're engaging with the phone, it's also a way of layering in dopamine. And it's no surprise that levels of depression and lack of motivation are really on the increase. Everything that we've talked about until now sets up an explanation or interpretation of why interacting with digital technology can potentially lead to disruptions or lowering in baseline levels of dopamine. I can use a personal example for this. I happen to really enjoy working out, I've always really enjoyed it. But in recent years I noticed that, if I was bringing my phone to my workouts, then not only was I a little bit more distracted and not focusing on what I was doing as much as I could have or should have, but also I started to lose interest in what I was doing. It wasn't as pleasureful, I would feel like it just didn't have the same kind of oomph. And I was beginning to question my motivation. As I started learning more about this relationship between the peaks and the bass lines in dopamine. What I realized was that some time ago I probably experienced a incredible increase in the amount of dopamine during one of my workouts, because I enjoy working out and I enjoy listening to music. I also enjoy listening to podcasts, I also enjoy communicating with people. Those are all wonderful pursuits, but I had layered in too many of them too many times. And then it essentially wasn't working for me anymore. Much in the same way a drug wouldn't work for somebody who takes it repeatedly because their baseline of dopamine is dropping. So at least for this calendar year, I've made a rule for myself, which is I don't allow my phone into my workouts at all. No music, at least not from the phone. It can be in the room. I might listen to a podcast in the room, but I don't listen to anything or engage in anything on my phone. No texting whatsoever. And most of the time I just don't even bring it with me for that period of time. It's only a short period of time. I'm not training that often. This is something that I think has been misinterpreted as people can't be alone now. People talk about, oh, you know, they can't walk across the street or they can't go anywhere, ride the bus, can't be on the plane without being in contact. They can't handle just their thoughts. I don't think that's really what's going on. I think what's happened is that we achieved the great dopamine increase that comes from this incredible thing which I personally enjoy being able to communicate by phone, by text and exchange pictures and send links and these kinds of things, social media. But then what happens is it doesn't have that same fulfilling aspect to it. And it tends to remove the excitement and the pleasure of the very activities that we are engaged in. So I know this is a hard one for many people, but I do invite you to try removing multiple sources of dopamine release or what used to be multiple sources of dopamine release from activities that you want to continue to enjoy, or that you want to enjoy more. And now you understand the biological mechanisms that would underlie a statement like that. It takes a little bit of working with, I know it can be challenging in the first week or so of not engaging with the phone during any kind of workout. That actually was really tough, but now I'm back to a place where I enjoy it that much more. I also feel as if I conquered something in terms of the circuitry related to dopamine. I now understand why something that I enjoyed so much had become less pleasureful for me. And there's a deep, deep satisfaction that comes from understanding, okay, there wasn't anything wrong with me or what I was doing or anything at all. It was just there was something wrong with the approach I was taking, which was layering in all these sources of dopamine and dropping my baseline. For this very same reason, I caution people against using stimulants every time they study or every time they work out or every time that they do anything that they would like to continue to enjoy and be motivated at. There's one exception which is caffeine, because as I mentioned before, if you like caffeine, that actually could be a good thing for your dopamine system, because it does upregulate these D2, D3 receptors. So it actually makes whatever dopamine is released by that activity, more accessible or more functional within the biochemistry and the pathways of your brain and body. However, a number of energy drinks and particular pre-workouts contain things that are precursors to dopamine, and on their own, even if you didn't engage in the activity would cause the release of dopamine to a substantial degree. They do cause the release of dopamine to a substantial degree. And over time that will deplete your dopamine. So energy drinks, pre-workout drinks, drugs of various kinds that people take to study and pay attention. We talked about some of these for the ADHD episode, things like Adderall, Ritalin, armodafinil or modafinil taken repeatedly over time will reduce the level of satisfaction and joy that you get from the activities you engage in while under the influence of those compounds. I'm not trying to demonize those compounds for their clinical use. What I'm saying is taking stimulants and then engaging in activities that you would like to continue to feel pleasureful is undercutting the process. And inevitably might not happen tomorrow, might not happen in a month, but inevitably you will have challenges with motivation and drive related to those activities. Now, some people can keep it right in check. They can just do the one can have the energy drink or they only do their pre-workout before really hard days, for instance. More power to you. I actually do that sometimes, frankly. But people who are trying to get into that peak super motivated, driven, driven state, really focused every time they engage in an activity, you are absolutely undercutting the process and you are undermining your ability to stay motivated and focused. So just as we talked about intermittent reward schedules a moment ago, intermittent spiking of dopamine if you do it at all is definitely the way to go, and chronically trying to spike your dopamine in order to enhance your motivation, focus and drive will absolutely undermine your motivation focus and drive in the long run. Ingestion of caffeine is somewhat of an exception among the other examples of things I've mentioned to avoid before what would otherwise be dopamine increasing activities. Because again, caffeine can increase the density and the efficacy of these dopamine receptors. It turns out that the source of caffeine could also matter while coffee or tea or other forms of caffeine will have this effect of increasing dopamine receptors. Yerba mate something I've talked about before on this podcast has some interesting properties. First of all, it contains caffeine. It's also high in antioxidants. It also contains something called GLP-1 which is favorable for management of blood sugar levels. Yerba mate turns out has also been shown to be neuroprotective specifically for dopaminergic neurons. Now, I should mention this is just a couple of studies, so we don't want to conclude too much from these studies more needs to be done. But they showed that in a model of damage to dopamine neurons, ingestion of yerba mate, and some of the compounds within yerba mate can actually serve to preserve the survival of dopamine neurons in both the movement related pathway and the motivation pathway. So perhaps you need that incentive in order to ingest your yerba mate, perhaps you don't need any incentive. In my case, I don't need any incentive. I already enjoy yerba mate as my principle source of caffeine, although I do drink coffee as well. But if one were going to consume caffeine, you might consider consuming that caffeine in the form of yerba mate both for sake of upregulating dopamine receptors and getting more of a dopamine increase. And of course, for the similar properties of caffeine if that's what you're seeking. And in addition to that, because your yerba mate does appear to have some sort of neuroprotective and a particular dopamine neuron protective properties. Now, that doesn't mean that caffeine is always beneficial. And actually there's one instance related to dopamine where caffeine can be particularly dangerous. And this relates to MDMA so-called ecstasy. MDMA is under investigation in various clinical trials for its potential to treat trauma and depression. It's also of course, a drug that's used recreationally. It's still illegal at least in the United States. Whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic has been very controversial. Early on it was thought that it is neurotoxic that it can destroy serotonergic neurons. There were other papers that came out which argued that's not the case. And that's in particular because one of the early papers published in science magazine claiming that MDMA was neurotoxic. That paper was retracted. It turns out that that study had mistakenly used methamphetamine instead, and methamphetamine is known to be neurotoxic. I think most of the data point to the idea that MDMA might not be neurotoxic, but in any case, caffeine has been shown to increase the toxicity of MDMA receptors. And you might say, \"Well, how could that be?\" Well, now you understand why that could be. Caffeine increases the density and efficacy of these dopamine receptors, D2 and D3 receptors. MDMA is a potent drug for increasing concentrations of dopamine as well as serotonin and other neuromodulators. And it appears that caffeine ingestion by upregulating these receptors, can lead to more toxicity of MDMA. So caffeine can be a beneficial substance in one context, and actually can be a detrimental if not dangerous substance in another context. Two substances that greatly increase dopamine, namely amphetamine and cocaine can cause long-term problems with the dopaminergic pathways. And this is largely based on a study that was published some years ago, 2003, but still holds a lot of merit. This is a paper published in proceeds in the National Academy of Sciences, a very high tier stringent journal. First author is Kolb, K-O-L-B. And the title of the paper pretty much tells the story. Amphetamine or cocaine limits the ability of later experience to promote structural plasticity in the neocortex and nucleus accumbens. Neocortex is the outer shell of the brain more or less. And the nucleus accumbens is part of that, mesolimbic dopamine pathway for motivation drive and reinforcement. Neuroplasticity of course, is the brain's ability to change in response to experience. And neuroplasticity is the basis of learning and memory and essentially remodeling of our neural circuitry in positive ways of all kinds. And this study was really one of the first to show that ingesting amphetamine and cocaine because of the high peak in dopamine that it creates and the low dopamine state, the baseline drop that it creates afterwards, limits plasticity and learning subsequent to taking amphetamine and cocaine. It was at least in this study shown to be a long lasting effect. I doubt it's a permanent effect, but this should serve as a serious cautionary note that amphetamine and cocaine not only can cause a drop in baseline dopamine, but can actually put the brain into a state in which it cannot learn and modify itself to get better at least for some period of time. In a previous episode on ADHD, I talked about the widespread use of drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, modafinil and armodafinil, all of which lead to very large increases in dopamine, and for people with ADHD can really improve their symptoms. But of course there's a lot of non-prescription, non-clinical use of those compounds as well. And it stands to reason that the use of those substances to increase dopamine could very well provide the same sort of blockade of neuroplasticity that cocaine and amphetamine do. Because when you look at the amount of dopamine increase that's triggered by those compounds, it's really comparable. So again, a cautionary note against spiking one's dopamine too much on a regular basis, unless there's a valid clinical need for doing that. So we've been focusing a lot for the last few minutes on the kind of darker side of dopamine and how getting big peaks in dopamine can be detrimental, but I want to acknowledge the truth, which is that dopamine feels great. Being in pursuit and motivated and craving things feels wonderful. And I don't want to demonize dopamine. What I'm trying to do today is to illustrate how dopamine works in your brain so that you can continue to engage in dopamine evoking activities. And certainly there is a place for ingesting things that can increase dopamine provided that they are safe for us in the short and long-term. There are activities that we can do that will give us healthy, sustained increases in dopamine, both the peaks when they happen and to maintain or even increase our baseline levels of dopamine. So how do we do that? What are some of these activities? Well, in recent years, there's been a trend toward more people doing so-called cold exposure. In part, this was popularized by Wim Hof, the so-called 'Iceman' getting into cold showers, taking ice baths, exposing oneself to cold water of various kinds can in fact increase our levels of dopamine as well as the neuromodulator norepinephrine. This is not a new phenomenon. In the 1920s, a guy by the name of Vincent Priessnitz was one of the first people to popularize and formalize cold water therapies. He was an advocate of cold water exposure in order to boost the immune system and increase feelings of wellbeing. And actually this practice dates back long before Vincent's popularized it. And Wim Hof is the more recent iteration of this. First of all, some of the safety parameters. Let's establish those first. Getting to very, very cold water. You know, 30 degree Fahrenheit or even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody into a state of cold water shock. I mean, people can die doing that. So obviously you want to approach this with some caution, but for most people getting into 60 degree water or 50 degree water, or if you're acclimated and comfortable with it, you know, 40 degree water or 45 degree water can have tremendously beneficial results on your neuromodulator systems, including dopamine. What temperature of water you can tolerate will depend on how cold water adapted you are, and how familiar you are with the experience of getting into cold water. And when I say comfortable with, I should mention, there is never a case in which getting into cold water does not evoke a release of epinephrin. So the quickening of the breath, the widening of the eyes, the feeling as if you can't catch your breath and even some physical pain at the level of the skin that happens almost every time, or every time that you get into cold water, even if your cold water adapted. What almost everybody knows and understands is that, that wall, as I like to refer to it is coming. That's always the first experience of getting into cold water. There's no real way around that. Now, this study that I mentioned earlier, human physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures, really interesting study that was done and published in the university of, excuse me, the European Journal of Applied Physiology. I can provide a link to that study in the show caption. It's a really interesting study. They looked at people getting exposed to water that was warm, moderately cold or very cold. It was 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius, or 14 degrees Celsius. You can just put those online and do the conversion, or you can do the conversion to Fahrenheit if you like. But in any case, what they looked at were the concentrations of things like epinephrin and dopamine and so on. And what they found was really interesting. First of all, upon getting into cold water, the changes in adrenaline and noradrenaline, epinephrin and norepinephrine were immediate and fast, and these were huge increases. So that's the getting into the cold water that everybody experiences these huge increases in adrenaline. But then what was interesting is they observed that dopamine levels started to rise somewhat slowly and then continued to rise and reach levels as high as 2.5 times above baseline. That's a remarkably high increase. Remember if we go back to our examples of chocolate, sex, a doubling above baseline, nicotine two and a half times above baseline, cocaine. The increase in dopamine from a cold water exposure of this kind was comparable to what one sees from cocaine, except, except in this case, it wasn't a rise and crash. It was actually a sustained rise in dopamine that took a very long time up to three hours to come back down to baseline. Which is really remarkable, and I think this explains some of the positive, mental and physical effects that people report subjectively after doing cold water exposure. One question that many of you are probably asking is just how cold should the water be? Well, you could mimic what was done in this study and do 14 degrees Celsius. But for some people that won't be cold enough, for some people that will be too cold. They did look at the release of stress hormones like cortisol in addition to the release of things like epinephrin and adrenaline. And it's interesting that they noted that in all cases, but especially at that coldest temperature, there was an increase in cortisol, but that it was transient, That eventually people's cortisol, the stress hormone subsided a bit. There are basically two different approaches to remaining in the cold when it's uncomfortable. One is to try and relax yourself. Two, try and practice slow breathing, to try and dilate your gaze. I've talked about this before in previous podcasts, you go into panoramic vision to essentially try and calm yourself so that it's not as stressful in the cold. Other people however, take the approach of trying to ramp up their level of internal autonomic arousal, meaning to get really energized and kind of lean into the friction of the cold. And they find that easier. Other people distract themselves, they recite the alphabet, or they do something, anything to try and distract themselves from the discomfort. To be totally honest, it does not matter for sake of dopamine release. Because the dopamine release is triggered and then continues even after you get out of the cold water. Now, in this study, it was long exposure to cold water. It was an hour. That's a long period of time. And I do warn you against getting into cold water that's so cold that it will make your temperature drop and make you hyperthermic for an hour. That actually could be dangerous for a lot of people. You might have a hard time reheating, and hypothermia is not a good thing. They had people monitoring subjects in these studies and paying attention to their core body temperature. They were able to reheat them afterwards. It's well-established now that getting into cold water, whether or not it's a shower, an ice bath circulating cold water, a stream, et cetera, that can evoke the norepinephrine release immediately, and the long arc of that dopamine release. Why would that be good? Up until now, I've basically said getting increases in dopamine are detrimental to your baseline. Well, this does appear to raise the baseline of dopamine for substantial periods of time. And most people report feeling a heightened level of calm and focus after getting out of cold water. So cold water exposure turns out to be a very potent stimulus for shifting the entire milieu, the entire environment of our brain and body and allowing many people to feel much, much better for a substantial period of time after getting out of the ice bath or cold water of any kind than they did before. Now, you might ask how often to do this? Some people do this every day. It can be very stimulating. So typically doing it early in the day, it's going to be better. I don't necessarily recommend doing it right before sleep, but some people do it in the afternoon. And some people will indeed do that seven days a week, other people three days a week, other people every once in a while. What I can say is once you become cold water adapted, once it no longer has the same impact of novelty and feeling a bit like a, I don't want to say a shock to your system, 'cause you don't want to go into cold water shock, but once it is comfortable for you, then it will no longer evoke this release. There really does seem to be something in the pathway from cold water exposure through the norepinephrine pathway and into the mesolimbic brainstem that causes this release in dopamine. But nonetheless, it's a basically zero cost. I mean, you need access to water of some sort, cold water shower, et cetera, but basically zero cost way of triggering a long lasting increase in dopamine without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever. Please again, approach it with a safety and caution in mind, but it is a very potent stimulus. Again, 250% of a rise in baseline, two and a half times rise in baseline rivals that of cocaine which is really remarkable. Now, I'd like to talk about the positive aspects of rewards for our behavior, and the negative aspects of rewards for our behavior. And from that, I will suggest a protocol by which you can achieve a better relationship to your activities and to your dopamine system. In fact, it will help tune up your dopamine system for discipline, hard work and motivation. Hard work is hard. Generally, most people don't like working hard. Some people do, but most people work hard in order to achieve some end goal. End goals are terrific and rewards are terrific whether or not they are monetary social or any kind. However, because of the way that dopamine relates to our perception of time, working hard at something for sake of a reward that comes afterward, can make the hard work much more challenging and make us much less likely to lean into hard work in the future. Let me give you a couple examples by way of data and experiments. There's a classic experiment done actually at Stanford many years ago in which children in nursery school and kindergarten drew pictures, and they drew pictures cause they like to draw. The researchers took kids that liked to draw and they started giving them a reward for drawing. The reward generally was a gold star or some thing that a young child would find rewarding. Then they stopped giving them the gold star. And what they found is the children had a much lower tendency to draw on their own. No reward. Now, remember this was an activity that prior to receiving a reward, the children intrinsically enjoyed and selected to do. No one was telling them to draw. What this relates to is so-called intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement. When we receive rewards, even if we give ourselves rewards for something, we tend to associate less pleasure with the actual activity itself that evoked the reward. Now, that might seem counterintuitive, but that's just way that the way that these dopaminergic circuits work. And now understanding these peaks in baselines in dopamine which I won't review again, this should make sense. If you get a peak in dopamine from a reward, it's going to lower your baseline and the cognitive interpretation is that you didn't really do the activity because you enjoyed the activity. You did it for the reward. Now, this doesn't mean all rewards of all kinds are bad, but it's also important to understand that dopamine controls our perception of time. When and how much dopamine we experience is the way that we carve up what we call our experience of time. When we engage in an activity, let's say school or hard work of any kind or exercise because of the reward we are going to give ourselves a receive at the end, the trophy, the sundae, the meal, whatever it happens to be. We actually are extending the time bin over which we are analyzing or perceiving that experience. And because the reward comes at the end, we start to dissociate the neural circuits for dopamine reward that would have normally been active during the activity. And because it all arrives at the end over time, we have the experience of less and less pleasure from that particular activity while we're doing it. Now, this is the antithesis of growth mindset. My colleague at Stanford, Carol Dweck, as many of you know, has come up with this incredible theory and principle, and actually goes beyond theory and principle called \"Growth Mindset\", which is this striving to be better to be in this mindset of I'm not there yet, but striving itself is the end goal. And that of course delivers you to tremendous performance. It's been observed over and over and over again, that people that have growth mindset, kids that have growth mindset end up performing very well because they're focused on the effort itself. And all of us can cultivate growth mindset. The neural mechanism of cultivating growth mindset involves learning to access the rewards from effort and doing. And that's hard to do because you have to engage this prefrontal component of the mesolimbic circuit. You have to tell yourself, okay, this effort is great, this effort is pleasureful. Even though you might actually be in a state of physical pain from the exercise, or I can recall this from college, just feeling like I wanted to get up from my desk, but forcing myself to study, forcing myself and forcing myself. What you find over time is that you can start to associate a dopamine release. You can evoke dopamine release from the friction and the challenge that you happen to be in. You completely eliminate the ability to generate those circuits and the rewarding process of being able to reward friction while in effort, if you are focused only on the goal that comes at the end. Because of the way that dopamine marks time. So if you say, oh, I'm going to do this very hard thing, and I'm going to push and push and push and push for that end goal that comes later. Not only do you enjoy the process of what you're doing less, you actually make it more painful while you're engaging in it. You make yourself less efficient at it, because if you were able to access dopamine while in effort, dopamine has all these incredible properties of increasing the amount of energy in our body, and in our mind, our ability to focus by way of dopamines conversion into epinephrin. But also you're undermining your ability to lean back into that activity the next time. The next time you need twice as much coffee and three times as much loud music, and four times as much energy drink and the social connection just to get out the door in order to do the run or to study. So what's more beneficial in fact can serve as a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors that you engage in. Especially hard endeavors is to A, not start layering in other sources of dopamine in order to get to the starting line, not layering in other sources of dopamine in order to be able to continue, but rather to subjectively start to attach the feeling of friction and effort to an internally generated reward system. And this is not meant to be vague, this is a system that exists in your mind, that exists in the minds of humans for hundreds of thousands of years, by which you're not just pursuing the things that are innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth, water when you're thirsty. But the beauty of this mesolimbic reward pathway that I talked about earlier is that, it includes the forebrain. So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part. I know it's painful, I know this doesn't feel good, but I'm focused on this. I'm going to start to access the reward. You will find the rewards, meaning the dopamine release inside of effort if you repeat this over and over again. And what's beautiful about it is that, it starts to become reflexive for all types of effort. When we focus only on the trophy, only on the grade, only on the win as the reward, you undermine that entire process. So how do you do this? You do this in those moments of the most intense friction. You tell yourself this is very painful and because it's painful, it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later, meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine, but you also have to tell yourself that in that moment you are doing it by choice and you're doing it because you love it. And I know that sounds like lying to yourself, and in some ways it is lying to yourself, but it's lying to yourself in the context of a truth which is that you want it to feel better. You want it to feel even pleasureful. Now, this is very far and away different from thinking about the reward that comes at the end, the hot fudge sundae for after you cross the finish line and you can replace hot fudge sundae with whatever reward happens to be appealing to you. We revere people who are capable of doing what I'm describing. David Goggins comes to mind is a really good example. Many of you are probably familiar with David Goggins, former Navy SEAL who essentially has made a post-military career out of explaining and sharing his process of turning the effort into the reward. There are many other examples of this too, of course. Throughout evolutionary history, there's no question that we revered people who were willing to go out and forage and hunt and gather and caretake in ways that other members of our species probably found exhausting and probably would have preferred to just put their feet up or soaked them in a cool stream rather than continue to forage. The ability to access this pleasure from effort aspect of our dopaminergic circuitry is without question the most powerful aspect of dopamine and our biology of dopamine. And the beautiful thing is it's accessible to all of us. But just to highlight the things that can interfere with, and prevent you from getting dopamine release from effort itself, don't spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort. And don't spike dopamine after engaging in effort, learn to spike your dopamine from effort itself. One straightforward example of learning to attach dopamine to effort and strain as opposed to a process or a reward that naturally evokes dopamine release is so-called intermittent fasting. I know this is very popular nowadays. Some people like to do intermittent fasting, some people don't. Some people have a 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours, some people do long fasts of two to three days even. I personally don't monitor a feeding window with a lot of precision. I tend to skip one meal a day, either breakfast or lunch, and then I eat the other two meals of the day depending on which meal I skipped. So it's either breakfast, lunch and maybe a little something in the evening, or I'll skip breakfast and do lunch and dinner and so on. Many people are now eating this way in part, because many people find it easier to not eat at all than to eat a smaller portion of some food. And that has everything to do with the dopamine reward evoking properties of food. When we ingest food or when we are about to ingest food, our dopamine levels go up. And typically when we ingest food, if it evokes some dopamine release, then we tend to want even more food. Remember dopamine's main role is one of motivation and seeking. And what dopamine always wants more of is more dopamine. More activity or thing that evokes more dopamine release. Well, let's just look at fasting from the perspective of dopamine schedules and dopamine release and peaks and baselines. Typically, when we eat we get dopamine release, especially when we eat after being very hungry. If you've ever gone camping, or you're very, very hungry, the food tastes that much better. And that's actually because of the way that deprivation states increase the way that dopaminergic circuits work. Our perception of dopamine is heightened when the receptors for dopamine have not seen much dopamine lately, they haven't bound much dopamine. So when you fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, and then you finally eat, it evokes more dopamine release. So this is the big reward that comes at the end. Even bigger because you deprived yourself. This is true for all rewarding behaviors and activities by the way. The longer you restrict yourself from that activity, the greater the dopamine experience when the dopamine is finally released, because of an upregulation of the receptors for dopamine. but I just spent five minutes or more telling you that you should avoid too much reward at the end, and you should actually focus on the dopamine that you can consciously evoke from the deprivation strain and effort. And in fact, this is what happens for many people that start doing fasting and take a liking to it. Many people say that their state of mind when they fast is clearer, that they actually start to enjoy the period of fasting. In fact, some people start pushing out their eating window or skipping entire days of eating more and more in order to get deeper into that state of mind where surely it's not just dopamine, but dopamine is released. They will track their clock. Oh, I've been fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera. They are starting to attach dopamine release or create dopamine release from the deprivation, not from the food reward itself. And this I think makes it an interesting practice. And one that certainly has been practiced by for centuries in different cultures and different religions of deliberately restricting food, not just to increase the rewarding properties of food itself, but also to increase the rewarding properties of deprivation. And I should emphasize that a lot of the subjective aspects of the knowledge of the benefits of fasting serve as reinforcing dopamine amplifying aspects to fasting, meaning if somebody does intermittent fasting and they are deep into their fast and they're telling themselves, oh, my blood lipid profiles are probably improving. And my glucose management is probably improving. My insulin sensitivity is going up, and I'm going to live longer. All these things that have some basis from animal studies and some basis or not from human studies, it's all kind of still an emerging literature, but it does seem to be pointing in that direction that fasting can encourage things like autophagy, the engulfment of dead cells and things of that sort. Well, as people tell themselves these things, they are enhancing the rewarding properties of the behavior of fasting. And so this is a salient example of where knowledge of knowledge can actually help us change these deep primitive circuits related to dopamine. And this illustrates how the forebrain, which carries knowledge and carries interpretation and rational thought can be used to shape the very circuits that are involved in generating reward for what would otherwise just be kind of primitive behaviors, hardwired behaviors. And that's the beauty of these dopamine circuits. That's the beauty of dopamine. It's not just attached to the more primitive of food, sex, heat, et cetera. It's also attached to the things that we decide are good for us and are important for us. So telling yourself that exercise or fasting or studying or listening better or any kind of behavior is good for you will actually reinforce the extent to which it is good for you at a chemical level. And a somewhat eerie example of what I just mentioned was a study that was published last year in the journal Neuron, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. That showed that hearing something that reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine release. So the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable to subjective interpretation that it actually makes it such that when we see something or hear something that validates a belief that we already have, that itself can increase dopamine release. Along the lines of how dopamine and dopamine schedules and our perception of things can shape the way that we experience things as pleasureful or not. There are beautiful studies mainly looking at sugar appetite and our sense of pleasure from sweet things, but also for savory foods, et cetera. And essentially the results that come out of this are the following. If you ingest something that you like, it tastes good to you, but then you ingest something that's even sweeter or even more savory. And then you go back to the food that you ate previously. Well, you don't like it as much, and that might seem like a duh, obviously. But that shift in perception can be blocked by blocking the shift in dopamine. And so this really speaks to these peaks and valleys in dopamine that I mentioned before and how your experience of anything is going to depend on your prior experience of other things that evoke dopamine. Big dopamine release makes it more challenging to experience more big dopamine release. So dopamine is one of those things that you don't want too high or too low for too long. It's all about staying in that dynamic range and that's going to be different for everybody. So for the very savory foods that are now everywhere, those highly savory foods or I think they call them highly palatable foods are making more bland foods, whole foods, meaning foods that aren't processed. It's making those tastes less good at least for a while. And all it takes is a short period of time, even just days, two days or so of not consuming any highly palatable foods and suddenly broccoli with just a little bit of seasoning tastes delicious to you. All right? So again, this just speaks to the fact that dopamine is this universal currency. It establishes value based on, not just what you're experiencing in the moment, but what you experienced in the days and minutes before. Now, that you understand how your previous level of dopamine relates to your current level of dopamine, and how your current level of dopamine will influence your future level of dopamine, it should become obvious why things like pornography, not just the accessibility of pornography, but the intensity of pornography can negatively shape real world romantic and sexual interactions. This is a serious concern. The discussion is happening now. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms you now understand. And this isn't to pass judgment on whether or not people like or don't like pornography, that's an ethical discussion, and it's a moral discussion that has to be decided for each individual by virtue of age, et cetera. But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine release will make it harder to achieve the same level and certainly the greater level of dopamine through a subsequent interaction. So yes, indeed many people are addicted to pornography and yes, indeed many people who regularly indulge in pornography experienced challenges in real-world romantic interactions. You now understand the mechanisms behind what I'm telling you. Now, there are circumstances in which increasing levels of dopamine is desirable and advantageous and clinically helpful. Good example of this would be the drug Welbutrin also called bupropion which increases dopamine and norepinephrine. Wellbutrin bupropion was developed as an alternative treatment for depression because some people who take the so-called SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which as the name suggests increased serotonin suffer from serotonin related side effects. Things like decreased appetite, decreased libido, or sometimes increased appetite or other side effects that they don't want. And Wellbutrin seems to avoid the sexual side effects. It can blunt at appetite and these sorts of things because of the increase in norepinephrine and dopamine increases levels of motivation and craving, but also can create a state of elevated alertness that can sometimes get in the way of healthy eating and things of that sort. So one has to work with their clinician as psychiatrist. It is a prescription drug in order to find the dosage of Welbutrin that's correct for them. In addition, things like Welbutrin bupropion can increase anxiety because of the way that dopamine and norepinephrine are stimulating and tend to place people into heightened levels of alertness. Nonetheless, many people have gained terrific relief from depression from Wellbutrin bupropion, and many of those same people had serious trouble with some of the SSRI. So it does seem to be a very useful drug in certain contexts, both for depression and for the treatment of smoking for people desiring to quit smoking. And of course there are a lot of people out there who are seeking to increase their baseline levels of dopamine without taking any prescription pharmaceutical compounds. And nowadays there exist a lot of supplements to do that. The two most common ones that are directly within the dopamine pathway are Macuna Pruriens which is actually a velvety bean whose contents are l-DOPA. Believe it or not, the content of this being is the precursor to dopamine. So Macuna Pruriens is sold over the counter at least in the United States. And it literally is the precursor to dopamine. Meaning if you take it, you will experience very large increases in dopamine. Those increases are transient and very, very intense. And in fact, if you look at the constellation of effects of Macuna Pruriens, what you find is that they're pretty striking and they look a lot like if not identical to l-DOPA. The most obvious of those is in the context of Parkinson's disease. There are at least five studies that have shown that Macuna Pruriens can reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, much in the same way that l-DOPA can reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. And that shouldn't come as any surprise given what I just told you that is essentially l-DOPA. It also can reduce a particular hormone called prolactin. Dopamine and prolactin tend to be in somewhat push pull fashion. When dopamine is up, prolactin is down and vice versa. Prolactin is involved in milk letdown in women. It's involved in setting the refractory period for sex after ejaculation in males. The reason mating can occur and then not occur after a ejaculation is because of an increase in prolactin. Macuna Pruriens is often used a blunt prolactin, and they're actually a couple of studies showing that it can indeed do that. Macuna Pruriens has a number of other effects that lie in the sex and reproduction pathway that are worth noting. Sperm concentration, sperm quality is actually greatly increased by Macuna Pruriens. These are kind of curious effects until you understand a little bit more about the biology of dopamine which I'll mention in a moment, but there are several studies, four in fact that describe how Macuna Pruriens can increase sperm count, sperm quality, and sperm motility. So for those of you seeking to conceive children, Macuna Pruriens might be an interesting choice if you're interested in exploring non-prescription compounds. However, I should mention that any time you consume a substance that increases dopamine by mimicking dopamine or acting as a direct precursor to dopamine, there's almost inevitably a crash or a reduction in the baseline in dopamine that we referred to previously. So many people who take Macuna Pruriens feel really elevated, really motivated, really alert, all the sorts of things that one would expect from a dopaminergic drug which Macuna Pruriens is. And then they feel a low or a reduction in drive and excitement and enthusiasm after the drug wears off. Just like they would with other dopamine increasing compound. For that reason, many people have turned to the use of L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine is an amino acid precursor to l-DOPA. So it lies further up the dopamine synthesis pathway. And nowadays it's very common because all L-tyrosine is sold over the counter in the United States that people will take L-tyrosine as a way to get more energized alert and focused. Indeed, there are data that L-tyrosine will accomplish that. L-tyrosine is typically taken in capsule form or powder form anywhere from 500 to 750 to a 1000 milligrams. It is a potent stimulus for increasing dopamine. And the timescale for increasing dopamine is about 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion. Dopamine levels start to peak. The classic study that really nailed down the fact that tyrosine has this effect was published way back in 1983, Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism that directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation with tryptophan ingestion on plasma dopamine and serotonin. Tryptophan being a precursor to serotonin. And indeed what they found is that ingestion of L-tyrosine can increase the amount of dopamine circulating in the blood and in the brain too, of course. The L-tyrosine ingestion induced dopamine increases within 45 minutes and they were short-lasting after about 30 minutes the effect had dissipated, meaning the levels of dopamine had dropped down to baseline. And even though they didn't look at levels of baseline dopamine past that time point, the expectation based on everything we know about dopamine biology is that it would then drop below baseline due to the depletion of the readily reservable pool of dopamine vesicles that we talked about way back at the beginning of this episode. The nice thing about this study is it does show specificity of effect because ingestion of tryptophan did not increase dopamine instead it increased serotonin. So there's really specificity of these pathways that rule out any placebo type effects. I'm not suggesting that anybody, everybody increase their dopamine levels by way of tyrosine or Macuna Pruriens. For those of you that are seeking to increase your dopamine levels without prescription drugs, those are the most direct route to that. Of course, if you have a pre-existing dopaminergic condition, so schizophrenia or psychosis of any kind, bipolar, anxiety, things like Macuna Pruriens and L-tyrosine will not be good for you. And if you don't, you should just understand and expect that it's going to lead to an increase in dopamine. You'll certainly feel an elevated state for some of you that might be agitating, for some of you that might be really pleasureful, and then you will feel a crash afterwards. How deep is that crash will really depend on your biology and where your dopamine baseline began. So I personally am not a fan of using things like Macuna Pruriens at all for myself for the reasons I mentioned earlier, just too intense and too much of a crash. I do use L-tyrosine from time to time for enhancing focus and motivation, but I want to emphasize from time to time. So I might use it once a week, occasionally twice a week, but I've never been one to take L-tyrosine regularly in order to focus or train or do any kind of mental work. I just don't want to rely on any exogenous substance in order to get my dopamine circuits activated. And I don't want to experience the drop in dopamine that inevitably occurs some period of time afterwards. I should also mention things that can reduce your levels of baseline dopamine. One that is rarely discussed is melatonin. I have talked before on this podcast about melatonin, why I am not a fan of using melatonin in order to enhance sleep. It can help one get to sleep, but not stay asleep. Dr. Matt Walker sleep expert from University of California, Berkeley. I think I don't want to put words in his mouth, but in our discussion about melatonin on this podcast when Matt was a guest in his book and on other podcasts, Matt has generally stated that the use of melatonin except for treatment of jet lag is generally not a good idea. And I agree. I think that melatonin is not often thought about as impacting the dopamine pathway, but there's at least one study published in 2001 first author is Nishiyama just as it sounds. It's spelled just as it sounds. Acute effects of melatonin administration on cardiovascular autonomic regulation in healthy men. So the study wasn't specifically about dopamine, but they looked at norepinephrine and dopamine levels, and they found a statistically significant decrease in dopamine 60 minutes after melatonin administration. I've talked before about how viewing bright lights between the hours of 10:00 p.m and 4:00 a.m has been shown in studies by Dr. Samer Hattar, David Bersin, excellent circadian scientists to reduce levels of dopamine for several days after that light exposure. So dim the lights at night, if you can avoid exogenous melatonin, meaning if you don't have to take melatonin and you can find a better alternative that would be a good idea if you want to maintain healthy levels of dopamine. Now, there is one compound that you are all familiar with, and you've probably actually taken without realizing it, that increases dopamine. And that's something called PEA for phenethylamine, technically beta phenethylamine. And PEA is found in various foods. Chocolate just happens to be one in enriched in PEA and can increase synaptic levels of dopamine. I personally take PEA from time to time as a focus and work aid in order to do intense bouts of work. Again, I don't do that too often. This might be once a week or once every two weeks. I might use it for training, but typically I don't, it's usually for mental work. And I will take 500 milligrams of PEA and I'll take 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC. That's something that I personally do. That's what's right for me, it's within my margins of safety for my health. Again, you have to check with your doctor and decide what's right for you. It leads to a sharp but very transient increase in dopamine that lasts about 30 to 45 minutes. And at least in my system I've found to be much more regulated and kind of even than something like L-tyrosine and certainly much more regulated and even and lower dopamine release than something like Macuna Pruriens. One of the lesser talked about compounds that's out there, but that's gaining popularity for increasing dopamine and as a so-called nootropic is something called huperzine A. Huperzine A is a compound sold over the counter at least in the United States that can increase acetylcholine transmission, a different neuromodulator entirely. But what's interesting is that huperzine A somehow by way of interactions between the cholinergic system and the dopaminergic system leads to increases in dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Hippocampus, of course, being an area of the brain associated with learning and memory. And prefrontal cortex being associated with the mesolimbic pathway, decision-making focus, et cetera. And so I think the reason why we're seeing an increase in popularity of companies including huperzine A and nootropic compounds is both for the cholinergic stimulating properties, but also for stimulating dopamine release. I personally have never tried huperzine A. You can go to www.examine.com or put huperzine A into PubMed if you'd like to search around and see some of the science behind it. Again, I'm not recommending anyone take these things. In fact, I recommend against anyone just diving in, and starting to consume things without gaining knowledge about how they function, whether or not they're right for you. But nonetheless, I think in the years to come, we are going to see a lot more of L-tyrosine, PEA phenethylamine and huperzine as a way of tapping into the dopaminergic and cholinergic circuits certainly along with things like Alpha-GPC as non-prescription, short-lived somewhat milder alternatives to things that really spike dopamine, things like Adderall, Ritalin, modafinil, armodafinil and similar. And I can't help but share with you one more result. It's not related to pharmacology. It's related to behaviors and social interactions. And that's the very interesting and I would say important finding that was made a few years ago by my colleague, Rob Malenka, who's in our department of psychiatry at Stanford, showing that oxytocin and social connection is actually directly stimulating the dopamine pathway. I think for many years, all of us including me would hear and thought that oxytocin was in the serotonergic pathway that it was about pair bonding, and it was about some of these neuromodulators that were more associated with things related to feeling good with what we have in the present moment. That's typically what we think of when we think of the opioid system or the serotonergic system. The dopamine system is really about seeking and reward, but in a paper published in 2017 in the journal Science, excellent journal. The papers titled gaining of social reward by oxytocin, excuse me, in the ventral tegmental area. You now know what the ventral tegmental area, it's that area of the mesolimbic pathway. What this paper essentially showed is that, oxytocin social connection and pair bonding itself triggers dopamine release. And as everyone read this result, we all realized, ah, this makes total sense that for the evolution of our species, indeed for any species where social connections are important, it's also important to go seek social connections. And so, while it's fun to think about pharmacology and underlying neurocircuitry and cold water baths and all these different things related to dopamine schedules and reward mechanisms and attaching reward to effort and all the various things that we've talked about today in terms of science and tools and protocols, I'd be remiss if I didn't include description of this result and just emphasize that social connections, close social connections in particular that evoke oxytocin release. So those are romantic type, those are parent-child type, those are friendship related, and those can even be just friends at a distance related, right? It doesn't actually require skin contact to get oxytocin release, but oxytocin release is central to stimulating the dopamine pathways. So the take home message there is quite simple, engage in pursue quality, healthy social interactions. I know I've covered a lot of material today. I've really tried hard to focus on things that lie directly within the dopamine pathway and circuitries, as well as things that directly stimulate those pathways and circuitries. What I haven't talked about are all the things that indirectly serve the dopamine pathways. And out there on the internet and indeed in the scientific literature, you will find for instance, that things like Maca root can increase dopamine. Things like the gut microbiome can influence dopamine. And indeed they can, but they do that through indirect mechanisms. By creating a environment, a milieu in which dopamine and dopamine circuits can flourish. Maca is a good example of that. It will reduce cortisol and through some indirect pathways related to cortisol can increase dopamine. But it's not a direct increase in dopamine. And so as a consequence, it's rather subtle compared to the various compounds and behaviors that I talked about today. Indeed cold water exposure leads to huge increases in dopamine as we talked about before, and very sustained ones at that. I realize in giving you a lot of information about science and mechanism all the way from psychological biological to circuitry and synaptic transmission, volumetric transmission and so forth, that it might seem overwhelming. The most important thing is to understand, or that these dopamine pathways really are under your control. And the locus of control resides in the fact that your previous levels of dopamine are influencing your levels of dopamine right now. And your current levels of dopamine and where you take them next, will influence your dopamine levels in the next days and weeks to come. So I hope both with the mechanisms that you now have in hand plus some of the tools to tap into the dopaminergic system, both behavioral, pharmacologic prescription, and non-prescription, et cetera, that you'll feel that you have more control over your dopamine system. And certainly that you have a better understanding of your dopamine system so that you can modulate and adjust your levels of dopamine in the ways that serve you best.

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. [cheerful music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing aggression. I'm going to explain to you that there are several different types of aggression, for instance, reactive aggression versus proactive aggression. Meaning sometimes people will be aggressive because they feel threatened or they are protecting those that they love, who also feel threatened. There's also proactive aggression where people go out of their way to deliberately try and harm others. And there is indirect aggression, which is aggression, not involving physical violence, for instance, shaming people and things of that sort. It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms underlying each of the different types of aggression. And today I will define those for you. I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression. Talk about some of the hormones and peptides and neurotransmitters involved. I promise to make it all accessible to you, even if you do not have any biology or science background, I will also discuss tools, psychological tools and biological tools that one can use to better control aggression. Now, right here at the outset, I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression has to have an element of context within it. To be fair, human beings invest a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of energy, and indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression. Later I'll talk about neural circuits in the brain and body that reinforce, in other words, reward through the release of chemicals that make people feel good. Acts of aggression. However, what I'm mainly referring to is the context in which human beings will pay money in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression, put it simply people spend an enormous amount of money and time and energy watching other people engage in, for instance, aggressive sports. And we know that observing your team winning over another team causes the release of neurochemicals in your brain and body that make you feel good. And yes, that can make you feel more aggressive. We also know of course that most governments invest many billions if not trillions of dollars in infrastructure, technologies and human beings in order to engage in aggression if needed, so-called military warfare, et cetera. So today's discussion will include a description of aggression in the pathological sense. We'll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder that most of you probably haven't heard of, but is actually far more common than perhaps, you know, we'll talk about the role of things like attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, and how that can relate to aggression through the relationship between impulsivity and aggression. And we'll talk about verbal aggression, physical aggression, proactive aggression, as mentioned before, and reactive aggression. I'm certain that by the end of the episode, you will come away with a much more thorough understanding of what this thing that we call aggression really is. And when you see it in other people, I think it will make more sense to you. And when you observe it in yourself or the impulse to engage in aggression, verbal, or physical or otherwise, I hope that you'll understand it better as well. And of course, the tools that I will describe should allow you to modulate and control aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness and just generally to be able to engage with people in a more adaptive way overall. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all your foundational health needs. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it covers all of my basic vitamin mineral and probiotic needs. The probiotics are especially important to me. There are now abundant data showing that the gut microbiome, which is basically a community of trillions of little bacteria that live in our guts are beneficial for our immune system, for brain function, for mood and many other aspects of our health. The gut microbiome thrives on probiotics and Athletic Greens contains the proper array of probiotics to optimize the gut microbiome. Athletic Greens also has adaptogens for recovery from physical and mental exertion, digestive enzymes for gut health, vitamin C, zinc, as I mentioned before, all the other vitamins and minerals that you need in order to cover your basic needs each day. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and claim a special offer. That'll give you five free travel packs that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road and a year supply of Vitamin D3K2. There's now a wealth of data showing that vitamin D3 is important for many aspects of our immediate and long term health. Many people, even if they get out in the sunlight are not getting enough Vitamin D3, and the K2 is thought to be beneficial for calcium regulation and a number of other things important to our health. So again, if you go to athleticGreens.com/huberman, you can claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind, I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with some pretty tough challenges as you move throughout the day. For instance, if you go from a brightly lit region to a dimmer region, your visual system has to adjust. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with those sorts of adjustments in mind. So for instance, if you're outside in the shade, you move into the sun and then back into the shade, you don't have to take your sunglasses on and off. Their glasses were initially designed for sports performance and the great thing is they could be used for that, but also they have a terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them to work or out to dinner. I wear readers at night and when I drive at night and I wear sunglasses, if I'm out a lot on really bright days. The terrific thing about ROKA glasses is that even if you get sweaty, they won't fall off. So you can run with them, you can cycle with them. Or as I mentioned before, you can just wear them out and about. If you'd like to try ROKA, you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code \"Huberman\" to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's ROKA roka.com and enter the code \"Huberman\" at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that in my opinion are the very best you'll find. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress a little over a year ago, and it's the best sleep I've had ever since. If you go to the Helix site, they have a terrific sleep quiz that just takes a few minutes, ask you questions like, \"Do you tend to sleep on your side, your back or your stomach?\" Maybe you don't know because you're asleep, but many people do know. And even if you don't know that's okay, it will also ask you questions like, \"Do you tend to run hot or cold?\" Do you tend to wake up in the middle of the night or not? And by taking that brief quiz, they will match you to the specific mattress that's ideal for you and your sleep needs. And that's really what sets Helix Sleep mattresses apart. Everybody's unique, and they know that. So if you take this quiz, you'll get matched to a particular mattress. For me, it was the \"Dusk\" mattress D-U-S-K, but again, that's just me, and you may match to that one, or you may match to a different one. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress and sleeping much better, go to helixsleep.com/huberman. Take that two minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order and two free pillows. I also love their pillows. I've always had this issue with pillows that they heat up too much. I'm always looking for the pillow that can cool itself. Somehow the pillows stay nice and cool. They're also not too big, so I'm not propped up, not getting the Text Neck in the middle of the night, where I'm letting my chin push my chest, nor am I falling back and having trouble breathing in the middle of the night. They're designed just right. They also have a 10 years warranty and you get to try it out for a hundred nights, risk free. They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it. But I think that you will. Again, if you're interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows. Let's talk about aggression. I think that many people out there are put off by aggression, although others are drawn to aggression both in themselves and when observing it in others. The reason to talk about aggression is, that as mentioned before, the context of aggression really matters. So there are instances where aggression is adaptive. For instance, a mother protecting her children if she's being attacked, or if her children are being threatened. I think most people would agree that so-called maternal aggression of that sort, provided the context is right, is a great thing. Protecting our young is after all one of the primary adaptive drives of our species, and thank goodness it is. Of course, other forms of aggression like unprovoked, proactive aggression, somebody simply being violent to somebody else, even when unprovoked, most of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior, it can even evoke aggression in people when they observe that kind of behavior. So again, context really matters, but a more general and perhaps an even more important reason to think about and understand aggression is that by understanding the biology and psychology of aggression, you will be in a much better position to understand how all emotional states come to be, both in yourself and in others. For instance, many of you have probably heard the statement that I believe arises from pop psychology, not from formal academic psychology, that aggression is just sadness. It's a form of sadness that's amplified and it shows up as aggression. But when we look at the underlying biology and the peer reviewed literature on this, nothing could be further from the truth. We have distinct circuits in the brain for aggression versus grief and mourning, those are non-overlapping. Now that doesn't mean that you can't be sad and aggressive or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time, but the idea that sadness and aggression are one in the same thing is simply not true. And by understanding that, or perhaps by understanding that irritability and aggression are not the same thing, you'll be in a much better position to apply some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode in order to be able to reduce or eliminate, or if it's adaptive to you to modulate aggression. And yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression in some cases, even amplifying aggression can be adaptive. Now this of course is not the first discussion about the biology of aggression or the psychology of aggression. And we really can look to the beginning of the last century as the time in which the formal study of aggression really began. One of the names that's most associated with the formal study of aggression is none other than Konrad Lorenz. Some of you may be familiar with that name, others of you may not be familiar with that name. Konrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting behaviors and fixed action pattern behaviors. He's most famous, at least in scientific circles, for getting geese to believe that he was their parent. And if you were to put into Google Conrad with a K, Lorenz, just as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese, you're going to see a lot of photos of Conrad walking down roads with a lot of geese following him or swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him. He had a habit of geese adopting him because of the behaviors that he partook in. So he would swim out on a lake in front of a bunch of little geese and then they would think that he was the parent and they would imprint on him. He even lived with these animals and they lived with him, sort of a strange character from what I hear. But nonetheless, all this work was deserving of a Nobel prize because what he discovered were fixed action patterns. That is patterns of behavior that could be evoked by a single stimulus. Okay. This is really important. The idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors, like swimming behind a parent, or looking to somebody for comfort, and only them, the idea that you could get a huge category of different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts triggered by just the presence of that person is remarkable, because what it suggested and what turns out to be true is that there are neural circuits, not just individual brain areas, but collections of brain areas that work together to engage a pattern of behaviors. And that's the first fundamental principle that we need to define today, that when we talk about aggression, we are talking about activation of neural circuits, not individual brain areas, but neural circuits that get played out in sequence like keys on a piano, but that playing out in sequence means that aggression is a verb. It has a beginning, a middle and an end, and it's a process. It's not an event. And as you'll see, that turns out to be very important in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression, prevent it from happening before it's initiated, or maybe even prolonging aggression, if that's what's needed. Now, Konrad Lorenz had no real knowledge of neural circuits. I mean, obviously he knew there was this thing that we call a brain and a nervous system, and he knew that there were chemicals in the brain and hormones and things of that sort that were likely to play a role, but he really didn't take any measures to define what the neural circuits were, frankly, he didn't need to. He had his Nobel prize and he did all this beautiful work. He's known for an abundance of work, but he did think about what sorts of underlying processes could drive something like aggression. And he talked about one particular feature that's especially important, and that's this notion of a pressure. The idea that yes, certain hormones will bias somebody or an animal to be aggressive, certain neural transmitter states, and you'll learn what those are today will bias somebody to be more or less aggressive, maybe even submissive and passive, maybe outright proactively aggressive towards anyone or anything in front of them. And yes, of course there will be historical features based on their childhood, et cetera, et cetera. He understood that there will be a constellation of things that would drive people to be aggressive. And he described a so-called pressure, almost like a hydraulic pressure. Just think about fluid pressure in a small container being pushed, pushed, pushed until the can, or the container is ready to explode and how multiple features, multiple variables could impinge on that and create that pressure. It turns out that's exactly the way the system works. There is no single brain area that flips the switch for aggression. Although we'll soon talk about a brain structure that generally houses the propensity and the output of aggression. This notion of a hydraulic pressure that can drive us toward aggressive behavior or conversely can be very low pressure and keep us in a state of non-reactivity, maybe even passivity or submissiveness is a very important feature because it really captures the essence of how neural circuits work when we're talking about primitive behaviors generally. And you can start to notice this in yourself and in others, you can start to notice when you are veering toward aggression or when someone is veering toward aggression, verbal or physical. Now that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure that Lorenz was referring to, and it really does have an underlying biological basis. Now it was some years later that the first experiments came along, which really started to identify the brain areas and the biological so-called pressures that can induce aggressive behavior. And the person that really gets credit for this is a guy by the name of Walter Hess, who at that time was working on cats. And I know that when say working on cats, a lot of people will cringe. A lot of people have cats as pets, and certainly cats can be delightful. Some people like them more, some people like them less. Most people cringe at the idea of doing experiments on cats. I should say that these days, very few laboratories work on cats. Most laboratories that work on animal models will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies for their capacity to do genetics, on laboratory mice, sometimes rats, but usually mice. And occasionally you'll find a lab that still works on cats. Back in the time of Hess, very few laboratories worked on mice, most laboratories worked on cats or rats. And the reason for that is nowadays most laboratories use mice if they use animal models because of the genetic tools that exist in mice to knock out this gene or knock in this gene, et cetera, which can't be done in humans or non-human primates, at least not very easily at this point in history. So when I say he was working on cats, I realized that probably evokes some negative emotions in some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you, what we can do, however, is look at the data and make use of the data in terms of our understanding. What Hess did was he had cats that were awake and he was able to lower a stimulating electrode into their brain. Now keep in mind that the brain does not have any pain sensors. So after a small hole is made in the skull, electrodes are lowered into the brain. This is what's done commonly in human neurosurgery. And he was able to stimulate different brain areas and he was sort of poking around. And when I say sort of, he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose, he wasn't just poking around in there for fun. He was trying to identify brain regions that could generate entire categories of behavior, ALA Lorenz, right? These fixed action pattern behaviors. Eventually his electrode landed in a site and he provided electrical stimulation to the cat that caused this otherwise passive purring relaxing cat to suddenly go into an absolute rage. So arched back, hissing hair up. So called piloerection, where the hairs go up, animals try to make themselves as big as possible often when they're aggressive. Drooling, maybe even spitting, believe it or not, cats and other animals can do this. And the cat tried to attack him or anyone else, and anything else, even inanimate objects when he stimulated this particula brain area. So Hess obviously took notice of this incredible transformation in behavior. And the fact that when he turned off the stimulation of this particular brain area, the cat very quickly within seconds, went back to being passive calm kitty. Now, of course, he repeated this experiment in other animals because he had to confirm that it wasn't just happenstance, that there wasn't something unique about this one cat that perhaps he had stimulated an area that had been built up during the kittenhood of this cat and had been reactivated. Maybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life or scared and reactivation of a particular circuit, unique to that cat created this aggressive behavior. That wasn't the case, every cat that he looked at and stimulated this particular brain area, the cat would immediately go into an aggressive, almost rage type behavior. Now, of course we can't anthropomorphize. We don't know what the cat was feeling. For all we know the cat could be happy, although that seems pretty unlikely and later experiments done in mice, but also in humans confirm that indeed, stimulation of this brain area evoked not just behavioral aggression, but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger. So what was this incredible brain area, or rather, I should say, what is the brain area that harbored this incredible capacity to generate aggressive behavior in Hess's experiments? Well, for those of you that are regular listeners of this podcast, you'll probably be relieved to know that today we're going to talk about some new neural circuits, oftentimes we'll center back on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up. And for those of you that haven't heard them before, don't worry, I'll make it clear as to what those brain areas are and what they do. But today we're going to talk a lot about the so-called VMH or ventromedial hypothalamus. The ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus, meaning a small collection of neurons... What are neurons? Nerve cells, and that small collection of neurons that we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small. It's only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain and a matching 1,500 neurons on the other side of your brain and that combined 3000 neurons or so, it's not exactly 3000, but 3000 neurons or so is sufficient to generate aggressive behavior of the sort that Hess observed in the cat, and believe it or not, when you see somebody who's in an act of rage or in an act of verbal aggression or in an act of defensive aggression, protecting their family or loved ones or country, et cetera, almost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior. Those neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior. And next I'll describe some experiments that were done just recently within the last 10 years or so, but leading right up until this year and even last month that keep confirming again and again and again, that it is the activity of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that are both necessary and sufficient to generate the full catalog of aggressive behaviors. Now, before I go further to describe the beautiful recent studies on the VMH, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the important role of testosterone, and more importantly, estrogen, in the activation of aggressive behavior, that's right. That's soon to be clear to you why that's the case. I want to emphasize that the ventromedial hypothalamus is something that we should all care about. Why? Well, it turns out that many categories of psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders, and psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, and even certain forms of autism can include elements of aggression and even violence. Now it's certainly not the case that aggression and violence are present in all people who suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD or depression or autism or borderline personality disorder. I'm absolutely not saying that. However, it can be a feature of those. And it's a well described feature in terms of trying to understand the constellation of challenges that people suffer from when they have those. So thinking about the VMH goes way beyond just understanding basic aggression in the context of adaptive aggression. So, you know, when earlier I use the example, maternal aggression, that's one adaptive form of aggression. It also can be pathologic aggression, meaning it can harm ourselves or others. So keep this in mind as we go forward, because later we're going to talk about specific tools designed to modulate or prevent aggression in, for instance, people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and especially kids with ADHD. In the meantime, let's return to the VMH, this relatively small collection of neurons. And the reason I say relatively small is, well, your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons, maybe even trillions of neurons, the exact number of neurons isn't really clear, but it's a lot. And it certainly is a lot relative to the number of neurons this 3000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus that can evoke this aggressive response. Experiments done by David Anderson's lab at Caltech were really the first to parse the fine circuitry and to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior. These are important experiments and they're worth knowing about. What they did was they identified, first of all, where the ventromedial hypothalamus was in the mouse, that was pretty straightforward to do was sort of known before they started these experiments. And then they analyzed which genes, meaning which DNA, which of course becomes RNA and RNA becomes protein, which DNA and therefore which proteins are expressed in particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus. And it turns out that there's a particular category of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that make an estrogen receptor. And it is those neurons in particular that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior. How did they know this? Well, they used a tool that's actually been described by a previous guest of this podcast. We had an episode with the psychiatrist and bioengineer and my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine, Karl Deisseroth, he and others have developed tools that allow people to control the activity of neurons essentially by remote control, by shining light on those neurons. So in the context of an experiment on a mouse, which is what David's lab did, and these were the beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin who's now in her own laboratory at New York University, put a little fiber optic cable down into the brain into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse. The mouse is able to move around in its cage freely moving, even though it has a little tether, this little wire, it's a very thin wire. And that little thin wire is actually a little what we call optrode. And the experimentalist in this case, Dayu, was able to stimulate the turning on of a little bit of blue light and that blue light activated only those estrogen receptor neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus and the way she was able to do that, is she had introduced a gene that had been developed by our friend, Karl Deisseroth that allows light to trigger electrical activity in those neurons. So if any of that is confusing, or if all of that is confusing, here's the experiment. There's a mouse in a cage. It has a little wire coming out of its head. It doesn't notice, believe it or not. We know this 'cause it's still eating and mating and doing all the things that mics like to do on a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera. And the mere pressing of a button will activate a little bit of light released at the end of that wire, that light activates particular neurons in this case, it's the estrogen receptor containing neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus. When that mouse is in a cage with another mouse, a couple of things happen depending on what the other mouse is, or we could say who the other mouse is. If it's a male mouse and you put in there with a female mouse, the male mouse will attempt to mate with a female mouse provided that the male mouse has gone through puberty. He will try to mount and mate with the female mouse. Now female mice are either in a receptive phase or a non-receptive phase of their so-called estrous cycle. They don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle They have an estrous cycle. And on particular days of the estrous cycle, they are not happy to mate. They will basically keep their hindquarters away from the male mouse at all costs. They'll even attack the male mouse. On certain days of the estrous cycle, however, the female mouse will undergo what's called lordosis, which is an arching of her back and she'll allow the male to mount and mate with her. So a large number of experiments were done, but the first experiment really was to put the male mouse in with a female mouse who's in the so-called receptive phase of estrus. That is, she will allow mating and he starts mating with her and they go through the standard repertoire of mating behaviors that you observe in mice: mounting, thrusting, intromission as it's called in the mouse sex world. Well, I guess I don't know what the mice call it, but that's what the experimenters call it. And then afterwards that he will dismount, okay. So they observe this kind of mounting and sex behavior is very typical, but about halfway through the behavior, Dayu turned on the light to stimulate these estrogen receptor containing neurons only in the male mouse and what she observed was incredibly dramatic. The male mouse ceases from trying to mate with the female mouse and immediately tries to kill the female mouse. He starts attacking her. Then she turns off the light, the male stops and goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse. So I'm sure all of this was very confusing and disturbing to the female mouse. Nonetheless, that was the repertoire. They would mate. She would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons. The male mouse would immediately try and attack and kill the female mouse. And then she would stop the stimulation and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse, return to the attempt, at least, to mate with the female mouse. These are such dramatic shifts in behavior triggered only by the activation of only the small set of neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus. And for those of you that think that you can watch this sort of thing without being disturbed, I encourage you to go to YouTube. We will provide a link where you can see a video of this type of behavior. It's incredibly dramatic. The shift in behavior is almost instantaneous, occurs within seconds, if not milliseconds, thousandths of a second. The next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse with this stimulation with light capability in its ventromedial hypothalamus into a cage alone, but with a rubber glove filled with air or water. Mouse, walking around sniffing, peeing, which is what male mice seem to do. They seem to urinate everywhere, that's actually an interesting, perhaps interesting feature of male mice and actually many male animals, perhaps even humans. We don't know, or maybe we do know, basically this has been an observed time and time again in experiments, mainly by Lisa Stowers's lab at the Scripps Institute, that's characterized this. If you put female mice into an arena or a cage, they always urinate in a very small corner of that cage. Whereas if you put mail mice into an arena or a cage, the urinate everywhere, they have this obsession with spraying their urine everywhere, you can transpose that to human behavior if you like. In any event, Dayu put the mouse in the cage alone, but with this rubber glove, the mouse is walking around urinating, et cetera, doing whatever is that mice do, then she stimulates the activation of these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons, and the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove. It goes into a rage, attacking the glove as if it were another mouse or some other animate object. But of course it's an inanimate object. It's just a rubber glove. She stops the stimulation and the mouse immediately goes back to being completely calm or at least not attacking. Again, we don't know what the mouse was feeling. So these are very dramatic videos. Again, you can see them by following the link that we'll provide in the caption. If that sort of thing is going to disturb you, by to see, for instance, the attack, one mouse attacking another, please just don't watch them. I'm not interested in traumatizing anybody or you traumatizing yourself, that is. A number of different variations were done on this experiment. For instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice, as opposed to male mice, putting the female mice in with other female mice or with other male mice, no matter what variation one carries out, so it doesn't matter if it's male with female, male with male, female with female, et cetera, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus in a male mouse or a female mouse evokes this very dramatic, almost instantaneous aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done by Dayu Lin in her own laboratory and other laboratories have shown that the ventromedial hypothalamus connected with a bunch of other brain areas that are interesting, And I'll talk about some of those in a little bit, but one of them that I want to call out now is the so-called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus. This is a large structure in the back of the brain that houses things like neurons that can create opioids. We all know of the opioid crisis, but these are neurons that can produce endogenous, means made by the body, chemicals that can cause pain relief. You could understand why that might occur in a circuit for aggression, right? Even if one is the aggressor, it's likely that they may incur some physical damage and they'd want some pain relief. The PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits that eventually, through several processing stations, excuse me, arrive at things like the jaws. And in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior. Now aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting because in humans and especially in human children, biting is something that, while young children might do as a form of aggression, tends to disappear pretty early in childhood. And if it doesn't, it's often seen as a mark of pathology. I have a story about this, actually, when I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp and I'll never forget this, so we're playing soccer and in a rare stroke of luck or accident, I happened to score a goal. I wasn't a particularly good soccer player, especially not at that stage of my life. They later figured out that it was just better to make me a fullback, 'cause I could just wait there and do what fullbacks do. I was better at taking the ball or the person out than I was putting the ball in the goal. Nonetheless, I, again, by chance, scored a goal and I was trotting back to my side of the field, and all of a sudden I felt this sting in my back, a kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name, I'm not going to tell you what his name was. A kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back. And this of course resulted in a discussion and a timeout and all the usual things and parents I think got involved. I don't recall, I didn't think much else of it, but I recall that this was considered especially troubling behavior because he bit me as opposed to hit me or shoved me down or something that sort, and it does seem as if the tendency to use biting as an aggressive behavior is associated with a more primitive circuitry. Now here I'm truly anthropomorphizing. I don't know what this other kid happened to be thinking or feeling at the time, how could I? And I certainly am not going to say that biting in every case reflects a pathology, although I think there is general agreement in the psychology community, in the psychiatric community that past a certain age, the using of one's teeth to impart aggression and damage on others is a particularly primitive and troubling or at least for the observer or the person experiencing is a pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab has shown that activation of the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers a downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray which then triggers a whole other set of circuits of fixed action patterns. Here we are back to Lorenz with fixed action patterns, including swinging of the limbs, right punching. And this wouldn't necessarily be controlled punching, but also biting behavior. So it's remarkable to me, at least that we have circuits in our brain that can evoke violent use of things like our mouth or violent use of things like our limbs. That of course could be used for things like singing or kissing or eating or, you know, gesticulating in any kind of polite or impolite way. The point here is that neural circuits, not individual brain areas evoke the constellation of behaviors that we call aggression. Now, many of you are probably puzzled or at least should be because I've been talking about this highly specialized brain area, the ventromedial hypothalamus and this highly specialized subcategory of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, these neurons that make estrogen receptors. And yet the activation of those cells triggers dramatic and immediate aggression, both in males and in females and both against males and against females. So what's going on here? Most of us think about estrogen and we don't immediately think of aggression. Most of us hear testosterone and we might think about aggression, although other things as well. In order to understand this, I just want to briefly refer back to a conversation that I had on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast. And that was with my colleague, the great Robert Sapolsky of course, is a professor at Stanford who studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior as well as estrogen and other hormones and their impacts on behavior. To make a long story short and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth. Testosterone does not increase aggressiveness, testosterone increases proactivity and the willingness to lean into effort in competitive scenarios. Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis, but to make a long story short, if people are given testosterone, or if you look at people who have different levels, excuse me, of testosterone, endogenously that they naturally make. What you'll find is that testosterone tends to increase competitiveness, but not just in aggressive scenarios. So if somebody is already aggressive, giving them testosterone will have the tendency to make them more aggressive. If somebody however is very benevolent and altruistic, giving them testosterone will make them more benevolent and altruistic, at least up to a point. Now, of course there are certain forms of synthetic testosterones that are known in sports circles and in other circles to increase aggressiveness because of the way those particular forms of synthetic testosterones work. But in general, most of the experiments that I'm referring to have not been done using those, they've been done using the let's call them the more traditional biological forms of testosterone or that resemble the biological forms of testosterone. In fact, Robert Sapolsky described a really interesting experiment in which, if you look at testosterone levels or you administer additional testosterone to people who are doing philanthropy, giving money to organizations and so they're essentially doing good because these are organizations doing good. What you find is that increased testosterone or further increasing testosterone makes people more willing to compete, to give more money than the other person in the room in order, you know, to put it in air quotes, \"To Alpha out the other person,\" by giving more money. So this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy. It is not an act of aggression. Of course, we don't know what the people are feeling underneath all that. Again, we can't anthropomorphize or project onto other people what they're feeling. But the point is that testosterone itself does not make people more aggressive. And in the experiments that we've been talking about up until now, it's actually the activation of estrogen receptor containing neurons that makes these animals more aggressive. And it turns out there's evidence that in certain context, estrogen can make people more aggressive. So what's going on here? Well, what's going on is that testosterone can be converted into estrogen through a process called aromatization. There's an enzyme called aromatase. Anytime you have word that ends in A-S-E, at least if it's in the context of biology, it's almost always not always, but almost always an enzyme. So the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen, and it is actually testosterone, aromatized, converted into estrogen and then binding to these estrogen containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression. I want to repeat that, it is not testosterone itself, that triggers aggression. It is testosterone aromatized into estrogen within the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that. Now this effect of estrogen causing aggression in the brain is very robust, so much so that if you take a mouse that lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme, and they do exist, then there is a reduction in overall aggression, despite high levels of testosterone. And if people who or mice who have the aromatase enzyme have that enzyme blocked, well, then it doesn't matter how much you increase testosterone or any of its other derivatives. You do not observe this aggression. So this runs counter to everything that we know and think about the role of testosterone. Again, testosterone increases competitiveness. It can increase the desire to work under challenge. I've said it before, and I ran this or pressure tested this against Robert Sapolsky who's been working on testosterone and it's role in the brain and behavior for many decades now. It is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect of making effort feel good, or at least increasing the threshold at which effort feels bad or unsustainable. And it does that by way of changing the activity or the threshold for activation of brain structures, like the amygdala and other brain structures associated with anxiety. So the next time somebody says, testosterone makes people aggressive. You can say, \"Ah, no, actually it's estrogen that makes people aggressive, and animals aggressive for that matter. Now of course it is the case that because males have relatively less estrogen circulating in their brain and body than females, right? Because they have testes, not ovaries, that testosterone is required in the first place in order to be converted into estrogen, to activate this aggressive circuit involving these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus. But nonetheless, it is estrogen that is the final step. It is the hormone on which aggression hinges. And I think for most people, that's a quite surprising finding. And yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings in both the animal and human literature, as it relates to hormones and psychological states and behavior. Now, of course it is the case that if testosterone is low, that a person or an animal will exhibit less aggressive behavior, but that's not because of reduced testosterone per se. It's because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone, meaning if there's no testosterone to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower. So we've established that it's not testosterone, but testosterone converted into estrogen that activates these circuits for aggression. But nonetheless, it's still surprising, right? I mean, most of us don't think about estrogen as the hormone that stimulates aggression, but it turns out it's all contextual. There are beautiful data showing that whether or not estrogen stimulates aggression, can be powerfully modulated by whether or not days are short or days are long. In other words, whether or not here's a lot of sunshine or not. Now, obviously brain is encased in skull. So it doesn't really know if there's a lot of sunshine out there even though you can see the sun with your eyes, you can feel it on your skin. Day length is converted into hormonal signals and chemical signals and the primary hormonal and chemical signals involve melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormones. So to make a very long story short, in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight, both in our eyes and on our skin, melatonin levels are reduced. Melatonin is a hormone that tends to produce states of sleepiness and quiescence. It also tends to activate pathways that tend to reduce things like breeding and sexual behavior. In long days, dopamine is increased. Dopamine is a molecule associated with feelings of wellbeing and motivation and the desire to seek out all sorts of things, all sorts of motivated behaviors. And in long days provided we're getting enough sunlight on our skin and to our eyes, the stress hormones, especially cortisol, and some of the other stress hormones are reduced in levels. If estrogen levels are increased experimentally under long day conditions, it does not evoke aggression. However, in short days, if estrogen is increased, there's a heightened predisposition for aggression. And that makes perfect sense. If you think about what short days do to the biology of your brain and body. In short days, the melatonin signal goes up. There's more melatonin circulating for more of each 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones are circulating more. Why? Short days tend to be associated with winter. In winter, we are bombarded with more bacterial viruses because bacterial viruses actually survive better in cold than they do in heat. In fact, in my laboratory, we work with a lot of viruses and bacteria and when we want to keep them alive, we put them in the freezer. If we want to kill them, if we want to inoculate them, we put them under UV light. Like you would see from the sunlight. So shorter days are conducive to aggression. Not because days are short per se, but because stress hormone levels are higher and because dopamine levels are lower. Now, here's where all of this starts to converge on a very clear biological picture, a very clear psychological picture, and indeed a very clear set of tools that we can think about and use. Under conditions where cortisol is high, where this stress hormone is elevated and under conditions where the neuromodulator serotonin is reduced there is a greater propensity for estrogen to trigger aggression. Now, again, I know I've said it before, but for males who make a lot of testosterone relative to estrogen, you have to swap in your mind this idea that if testosterone is high, that means that estrogen is low because while that can be true in the periphery in the body, if testosterone is high, there is going to be some aromatization, that conversion of testosterone to estrogen. So anytime you hear that testosterone is high, you should think testosterone is high in the body and perhaps estrogen is low in the body. But that means that there's going to be heightened levels of estrogen in the brain and therefore increased propensity for aggression. In females who generally make less testosterone relative to estrogen, there is sufficient estrogen already present to trigger aggression. So both males and females are primed for aggression, but that's riding on a context and that context of whether or not you get a tendency for aggression or not. depends on whether or not cortisol is high or low, and I'm telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher in any individual, there's going to be a tilt, an increase in that hydraulic pressure that Lorenz talked about toward aggression. And if serotonin, the neuromodulator that is associated with feelings of wellbeing and sometimes even of slight passivity, but certainly of wellbeing, if serotonin is low, there's also going to be a further shift towards an aggressive tendency. So if we return to Lorenz's hydraulic pressure model of aggression in other internal states, we realize that external stimuli, things that we hear, things that we see, for instance, someone saying something upsetting or us, seeing somebody do something that we don't like to others or to us, as well as our internal state, our subjective feelings of wellbeing, but also our stress level, our feelings of whether or not we have enough resources and are content with what we have. All of that is converging on this thing that we call internal state and creating this pressure of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive. And now we have some major players feeding into that final pathway. That question of whether or not will we hit the other, person, will we say the thing that is considered aggressive? Will we not say it? If somebody says something or does something aggressive to us, will we respond or will we be submissive or even passive? Again, there are many things funneling into that question and dictating whether or not the answer is, \"Absolutely I'll fight back,\" or, \"I'm going to attack them even unprovoked.\" Or if they say this, I'm going to do that, or no matter what they do, I'm not going to respond. These kinds of things are very complex. And yet we really can boil them down to just a few common elements. And I'm telling you that those elements are whether or not cortisol levels are relatively lower or relatively higher. Again, relatively higher is going to tend to make people more reactive. Why? Because reactivity is really a function of the autonomic nervous system, which is sort of like a seesaw that oscillates between the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which tends to put us into a state of readiness through the release of adrenaline. Cortisol and adrenaline when they're circulating the brain and body, make us more likely to move and to react and to speak. It's actually what will induce a kind of low level tremor, which is an anticipatory tremor to be able to move more quickly, right? A body in motion is more easily set into further motion, that is, and the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator that in general is associated with feelings of wellbeing in response to what we already have. So when we are well fed, serotonin tends to be released in our brain and body, in particular, well fed with carbohydrates, the precursor to serotonin is tryptophan. And indeed there are nice studies exploring the types of diets, nutritional programs that can reduce aggressive behavior, both in children and in adults and tryptophan-rich diets or supplementation with tryptophan. So for tryptophan rich diets, things like white turkey meat, but then there are also a number of carbohydrates you can look up. It's very easy to find foods that contain lots of tryptophan. Those foods contain the precursor to serotonin. Now it isn't simply the case that eating more foods with tryptophan will tend to reduce your aggression. I suppose it could do that, if you ate it in abundance, it could make you tired and then you're less likely to be aggressive, I don't recommend that strategy, but the idea here is that when it's been explored, increasing levels of tryptophan either by supplementation or by food or drugs, prescription drugs that increase serotonin. So for instance, fluoxetine sometimes called Prozac or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs tend to reduce aggressive behavior. Now, not always, but in general, that's the case. Similarly, because elevated cortisol tends to shift the whole system, again, create more of a hydraulic pressure towards aggressive states. If cortisol levels are reduced, well then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced. This is supported by a number of peer reviewed studies. We'll provide links to some of those in the caption show notes. And we're going to return to these a bit later in the context of specific studies that have looked at genetic variants in different individuals that cause them to make more or less serotonin, or at least to metabolize serotonin differently. This is also the case for so-called intermittent explosive disorder that can often be associated with gene variants that control how much serotonin is made or how it's metabolized or how much cortisol is made and how much it's metabolized. In thinking about tools that are a number of things that one could consider. First of all, there are a number of decent studies exploring how supplementation with the Omega-3 fatty acids, which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems, including serotonin that can modulate not directly mediate, but modulate mood and emotional tone supplementation with the omega 3 S has been shown to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain contexts in things like ADHD or in individuals who have a predisposition for aggressive type behavior or aggressive thinking. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that the omega 3 fatty acids are going directly to the ventromedial hypothalamus and changing the activity of neurons there more likely they are causing or modulating an overall shift in mood through the immune system, through hormone systems that are changing the overall tone or the propensity for neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus to be activated. How much omega 3 fatty acid, what source? Well, we've talked about this on the podcast before. You can, of course get omega 3 fatty acids from a number of different foods. Getting them from whole foods is probably the best way to do it, but many people, including people with depression will often supplement with one gram or more of omega 3 fatty acid per day. Some people including myself will take them every day as just a general mood enhancer. I don't suffer from depression, but I've found it be beneficial for my health. And so some people do that, and I've talked about before, how in double blind placebo controlled studies, people taking one to three grams of omega 3 fatty acids per day, typically in the form of a high quality fish oil, although there are other sources as well, algae and so forth, can experience improvements in mood that are on par with some of the SSRIs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. And of course, if you're prescribed an SSRI by your psychiatrist or other doctor, please do take that and don't cease to take it just simply to take omega 3s. However you might mention to them, and you can find links to the studies in our previous episodes on depression that supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids of at this one gram or more of EPA specifically, so getting above that one gram threshold, as high as three grams per day of the EPA has allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs and still keep their mood in a place that's beneficial for them. And in terms of keeping cortisol in a range that's healthy and doesn't bias someone toward high levels of aggression and irritability, that's again, going to be set by a number of larger modulators or contextual cues. And I've talked about some of those on the podcast, but I'll just briefly recap them now, obviously getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day, and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes throughout the day is going to be important. Again, because of this effect of estrogen in long days, not increasing aggression, however, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression because of the increase in cortisol observed in short days. Another way to reduce cortisol was discussed in our episode on heat and the use of sauna and heat, but also hot baths. It turns out that hot baths and sauna can be very beneficial for reducing cortisol. All the details on that are included in the episode on heat and it's timestamped, so you can go directly to that if you want to learn about the temperatures and the various durations, but to just give a synopsis of that, a 20 minute sauna at anywhere from 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius is going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol. If you don't have access to a sauna, you could do a hot bath, adjust the temperature so you don't burn yourself. I think 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius is going to be too hot for many people if it's a hot bath, whereas many people who can't tolerate that hot bath can tolerate the sauna. So safety first always, and of course, but hot baths reduce cortisol, hot saunas, reduce cortisol of a duration about 20 or 30 minutes is going to be beneficial. And of course, some of you may be interested in exploring the supplementation route and for reductions in cortisol, really the chief player there is ashwagandha, which is known to decrease cortisol, fairly potently. I should just warn you that if you're going to use ashwagandha in order to reduce cortisol, first of all, check with your doctor or healthcare provider before adding or subtracting anything from your supplementation or health regimen. Of course, I don't just say that to protect us. I say that to protect you, you are responsible for your health, what you take and what you don't take. Chronic supplementation with ashwagandha can have some not so great effects of disruption of other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways. So the limit seems to be about two weeks of regular use before you'd want to take a break of about two weeks. So ashwagandha again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol, but with some other effects as well, don't use it chronically for longer than two weeks. But if your goal is to reduce cortisol, let's say you're going through a period of increased irritability and aggressive tendency, maybe you're also not getting as much light as you would like, and perhaps also, if there are other circumstantial things leading you towards more aggressiveness and your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, that can be potentially helpful. And in light of all this stuff about cortisol and estrogen and day length, I should mention that there are in fact, some people who have a genetic predisposition to be more irritable and aggressive, and there are a couple of different gene pathways associated with this. We never like to think about just one gene causing a specific behavior. The way to think about genes is that genes generally code for things within our biology. In the context of today's discussion, things like neural circuits or the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made, or the amounts of hormones that are made, or the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors or enzymes, et cetera, that shift the activity of our biology in a particular direction. They bias our biology. And in fact, there is a genetic variant present in certain people that adjusts their estrogen receptor sensitivity, and that estrogen receptor sensitivity can result in increased levels of aggression, sometimes dramatic increases, however, and also very interestingly, photo period, meaning day length, is a strong modulator of whether or not that aggressiveness turns up or not. Whether or not that person with the particular gene variant is more aggressive or not, depends on how long the day is and how long the night is. One particular study that I like that references this is Trainer, et al, the title of the study is \"Photo period reverses the effects of estrogens on male aggression, via genomic and non-genomic pathways.\" This was a paper published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. We'll put a reference to this in the show notes, if you'd like to explore it further, but it really points to the fact that rarely, sometimes, but rarely, is it the case that just one gene will cause somebody to be hyper aggressive. Almost always there's going to be an interplay between genetics and environment and as environment changes such as day length changes and the length of night changes, so too, will the tendency for people with a given genetic variant to be more aggressive or not. Now, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing for this particular estrogen receptor variant, most people, I'm guessing you, are probably not walking around knowing that you have this gene or not. Regardless, I think it's important to pay attention to how you feel at different times of year, depending on whether or not summer, whether or not it's winter, whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight, meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not, whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight exposure to your skin or not, whether or not you're indoors all the time. Generally those things correlate with season, but not always. You can go through long bouts of hard work in the summer months when days are long, but you're indoors a lot and getting a lot of fluorescent light exposure late in the evening. And perhaps that's when you're feeling more aggressive. So we have to be careful about drawing a one-to-one relationship between any biological feature and certainly psychological or behavioral feature like aggressiveness, but it's, I believe, helpful to know that these genetic biases exist, how they play out again, they shift our biology in a general thematic direction. They don't change one thing. They change a variety of things that bias us toward or away from certain psychological and behavioral outcomes and the various things that we can do in order to offset them. And we described those earlier in terms of trying to keep cortisol low by getting sufficient sunlight regardless of time of year, and regardless of whether or not you happen to have this particular genetic variant. So earlier I talked about how it is testosterone converted into estrogen that's activating aggression in the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself. However, there are some studies carried out in humans that have evaluated the effects of testosterone and how levels of testosterone correlate with aggressiveness in the short term. I'm just going to detail a few of those studies because I think they are interesting and important. First of all, there is a study that has explored levels of testosterone in men of different professions. Now, before I tell you the data, I want to be very clear here, with a study such as this, one never knows whether or not these men went into a particular profession because they had a testosterone level of a given value or whether or not the work itself altered their testosterone levels or both. And I think it's fair to assume that it's probably both. So be very careful in assuming that a given testosterone level is causal for choosing a particular career or that a particular career is causal for creating a particular testosterone level. This study used salivary testosterone levels as the measure, which to be fair is not the best way to measure testosterone. Typically blood draw would be the best way to measure testosterone, but nonetheless, provided the appropriate methods are used, salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure of testosterone. The different occupations that were looked at were, and here they just looked at men in this particular study were ministers, salesmen, they didn't say what particular types of salesmen, firemen, professors, of all things, physicians and NFL players. And what they discovered was that the testosterone levels were essentially in that order from low to highest. So minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL player. Now we could micro dissect all the different stereotypes and all the different features of each of these jobs. For instance, we don't know whether or not the fact that the firemen happened, at least in this study to have lower testosterone levels on average than the professors or the physicians was because firemen have lower testosterone levels or because they have a much more stressful job and their cortisol levels are higher than the professor or the physician and cortisol and testosterone, not always, but generally are in somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode because they derive from the same precursor, et cetera. Typically, when cortisol is high, testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa. So we don't know what's causing these effects. And again, this is just one study and just six occupations, but I think it's relatively interesting given the fact that each of these professions involves different levels of competitiveness, right? So we don't necessarily just want to think about the level of physical exertion that's required, but also the level of competitiveness because it's known that competitive interactions can cause increases in testosterone, in particular, in the winners of competitive interactions, a topic for a future podcast. Meanwhile, studies that have analyzed also again, salivary testosterone in prisoners, in this case, female prisoners, so these are incarcerated individuals, have looked at levels of testosterone according to whether or not the person committed a non-violent or a violent crime in order to arrive in prison. And higher levels of salivary testosterone were related to those that had arrived in prison because of conviction of a violent crime, as opposed to a nonviolent crime. Likewise, when they analyzed prison rule violations, so an indirect measure of aggressiveness, but in this case, it was strongly associated with aggressiveness because they knew what the violations were, they found were for prisoners that had none, no prison violations, prison rule violations I should say, their testosterone levels tended to be lower than the testosterone levels of women that had some, even one, or more aggressive violations of prison rules. We'll provide links to these studies in the show notes if you'd like to go into them further, obviously studies like this need to be taken with a grain of salt because there are so many different factors, different prisons have different degrees of violence to begin with and competitiveness to begin with. But just as a final pass at examining the role between testosterone and aggressiveness, there was a very interesting study from Goetz, et al, G-O-E-T-Z published in 2014, that looked at serum, so in this case, blood levels of testosterone. 30 minutes after application of a gel-based testosterone that goes transdermal so that the testosterone can go very quickly into the bloodstream, and then did brain imaging to evaluate the activity of neurons in the so-called corticomedial amygdala, the cortico, the medial amygdala is one of the areas of the amygdala complex as we call it because it's complex, it's got a lot of different nuclei, you know, know what nuclei are, low clusters of neurons. It's got a lot of different ones, but that medial and that cortico medial amygdala in particular, is known to be associated with aggressive type behaviors. It's linked up with as part of the larger circuit that includes the ventromedial hypothalamus and other brain areas that we referred to earlier, such as the PAG. What is remarkable about this study is that it showed that just 30 minutes after application of this so-called AndroGel, this testosterone that seeps into the bloodstream, there was a significant increase in of course, testosterone and corticomedial amygdala activation. So testosterone can have acute effects, immediate effects on the pathways related to aggression. And I think this is something that's not often discussed because many of the effects of steroid hormones like testosterone, and estrogen are very slow acting. In fact, steroid hormones, because they have a certain biochemical composition can actually pass through the membranes of cells, so the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell and change gene expression in the cell, you think about puberty, the kid that goes home for the summer and then comes back looking completely different. Well that's because of a lot of genes got turned on by steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen, but the steroid hormones can also have very fast acting effects and with testosterone in particular, those can be remarkably fast acting and one of the most apparent and well documented fast acting effects is this effect: the ability to activate cells within the amygdala, so you might say, \"Well, I thought the amygdala was associated with fear?\" Wouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No. Turns out that the amygdala harbors, both cortisol, corticosteroid receptors and testosterone receptors, and they each adjust the activity in the amygdala differently, such that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry for inducing states of mind and body that are more action based and indeed in animals and in humans, testosterone application and activation of this corticomedial amygdala pathway will make animals and humans lean into effort. This is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good, or at least biases the organism toward leaning into challenge. So if you recall, there's not just one type of aggression, there's reactive aggression, which is triggered when one is confronted with something that sometimes is inevitable, right? One needs to fight for their life or for somebody else's life, but also proactive aggression and proactive aggression involves activation of those go-pathways in the basal ganglia and a leaning into effort to overcome whatever state one happens to be in to begin with. And so this is very important because it points to the fact that yes, estrogen is activating aggression pathways that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus, but it's very likely the case that testosterone is acting to accelerate or to bias states of mind and body toward those that will lead to aggression. Again, aggression is not like a switch, on and off. It's a process. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. Remember that hydraulic pressure that Conrad Lorenz hypothesized? Well, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure toward an aggressive episode and then estrogen actually triggering that aggressive episode in the ventromedial hypothalamus. So if somebody tells you that testosterone, endogenous or exogenous makes people aggressive, tell them no, testosterone tends to make people lean into effort. And if that effort involves being aggressive, either reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive, well then it will indeed lead to aggression. But the actual aggression itself is triggered by estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, we really haven't talked too much about the social context in which aggression occurs. And that's because there is a near infinite, if not infinite number of variables that will determine that. So for instance, violent aggression is entirely appropriate at a professional boxing match provided it's occurring inside the ring and only between the competitors and within the bounds of the rules of the sport, et cetera. However, there are some things that tend to bias certain social context toward being more aggressive or less aggressive and not always physical aggression. And those generally come in two forms that many of you are familiar with, which are alcohol and caffeine. Let's discuss caffeine first. Why would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity? Well, the general effects of caffeine are to increase autonomic arousal. The activity of the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which is to put it very much in plain language it's the alertness arm of your nervous system. That is, it creates a sense of readiness in your brain and body and it does so by activating the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, as I always remind people, simpa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy. Simpa means together, we're all at ones. And caffeine tends to bias our brain and body to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia, which run from about the base of your neck until the top of your pelvis and deploy a bunch of chemicals that jut out into the rest of your body, activate adrenaline release. There's a parallel increase in of adrenaline in your brain, creating the state of alertness and readiness. That state of alertness and readiness can be for all sorts of things, not just aggression. However when we are in a state of increased sympathetic tone, meaning more alert, such as after drinking caffeine, we will bias all those brain and body systems, the hormones, the chemicals, et cetera that exist, toward action as opposed to inaction. So put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there. On the opposite end of things, alcohol tends to decrease activity in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, tends to make us feel less alert. Now, initially it can create a state of alertness because of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain, our forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular has what's called top-down inhibition. It exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus, such as the ventromedial hypothalamus. The way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain is able to rationalize and think clearly and to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathways telling you, \"Don't say that mean thing.\" \"Don't do that violent thing,\" et cetera. Alcohol initially tends to increase our level of overall activity by reducing inhibition, not just in that forebrain circuit, but in other circuits. Tends to make us more active. We tend to talk more than we normally would, move more than we normally would, but very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative by way of reducing activity in the forebrain, releasing some of the deeper brain circuits that are involved in impulsivity, but also causing a somewhat sedative effect. And then of course, as alcohol levels increase even further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. So what we've got with alcohol and caffeine is we've got two opposite ends of the spectrum, caffeine increasing arousal and readiness, and the tendency for impulsivity and alcohol also increasing impulsivity, but through a different mechanism. A really interesting study, and I should just mention that the title of the study is, \"Caffeinated and non-caffeinated alcohol use and indirect aggression at the impact of self-regulation.\" So the title is almost self-explanatory. This was a paper published in the Journal of Addictive Behavior in 2016, examining how ingestion of alcohol that's either caffeinated or non-decaffeinated alcohol drinks impacted what they call indirect aggression. And just to remind you what indirect aggression is, these are not physical acts of aggression. These are verbal acts of aggression, so embarrassing others or otherwise, somehow trying to reduce the wellbeing of others by saying certain things in particular in groups, this study examined both males and females. This was done on by way of a college campus study, subjects were 18 to 47 years old. I guess there's some older students on that campus, or maybe they use some non-students, but you know, these days you've also got some students that are in their thirties and forties. So they have a fairly broad swath of subjects included, fairly broad racial background as well, included, not at equal numbers, but at least they included a pretty broad spectrum of people with different backgrounds. They looked in particular people that ingested non-caffeinated alcohol drinks at a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again, there's a college campus, not that I encourage that. I'm one of these people that I don't, I've never really liked drugs or alcohol and sort fortunate in that way I can drink or not drink and tend to not drink. But so to me, 9.18, drinks per week sounds like a lot, but I know for some people that might actually be typical. And then others who are drinking at least one caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. And those individuals end as high, I should say as 7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. So this would be energy drinks combined, typically with hard alcohol, that's fairly commonly available in bars and so forth. And some individuals drank as much as goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per week, total, some that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated. The basic outcome of this study was that the more alcohol someone tended to consume, the more likely it was that they would engage in these indirect aggressive type behaviors. And in terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, the effect was especially interesting. Here I'm just going to paraphrase or I'll actually read from the study, quote, \"With regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, our findings indicated that heavier caffeinated alcohol beverage use was associated positively with indirect aggression, even after considering one's typical alcohol use and dispositional aggression.\" What this means is that even though alcohol can bias certain individuals to be more aggressive, and even though certain individuals already have a disposition toward being more aggressive, there was an effect that was independent, meaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition, meaning if someone was consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had a particularly high likelihood of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior. Now this makes perfect sense in light of the model they propose, which is this self-regulation model, that basically self-regulation involves several things. It involves engaging in certain behaviors and suppressing other behaviors. So as described before, because alcohol tends to have a sedative suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system, at least after the initial period, it's going to tend to reduce the likelihood that people will engage in any type of behavior. Whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal and increase the likelihood that someone will engage in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise. So the combination of caffeine and alcohol is really acting as a two prong system to bias people towards more impulsivity that is less self-regulation. So it's really yanking your volitional control, your ability to engage in prefrontal top down inhibition over your hypothalamus from two distinct and specific circuits. By now, you should be getting the impression that self-regulation is a key feature of whether or not somebody, maybe even you, is going to engage in aggressive speech or aggressive behavior. And we've talked about a number of tools that one can use to reduce the probability that that will happen. I suppose, if the context were appropriate, you could even take those tool recommendations and just invert them and increase the likelihood that aggressiveness would happen. But regardless, self-regulation is key. And in light of that, I want to share with you a study that's focused on kids, but that has important ramifications for adults as well. As you probably are already aware there are many kids out there that suffer from so-called attention deficit hyperactivity, disorder, ADHD. There are also many adults we are finding that are suffering from ADHD. And there's also an epidemic I would say of people that are concerned about whether or not they have ADHD. Now whether or not they have true, clinical ADHD or not, is not clear. We did an episode all about ADHD and tools for ADHD. I would encourage you to check out that episode and some of the diagnostic criteria. If you have the opportunity you can find at hubermanlab.com, as this study I'm about to share with you aptly points out, there is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD. There's no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD, whether or not one has ADHD depends on their performance on a number of different cognitive tests and behavioral tests and self report. In any event, the study I'm about to share with you explored how a particular pattern of supplementation in kids with ADHD was able to reduce aggressive episodes and impulsivity and increased self-regulation. And the title of the study is, \"Efficacy of carnitine in the treatment of children with attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder.\" Even though they put carnitine in the title, that what they focused on was whether or not acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation could somehow adjust the behavioral tendency of these kids with ADHD and to make a long story short, indeed it did. There was a very significant effect of acetyl L-carnitine supplementation on improving some of the symptomology, excuse me, of ADHD. A few details about this study that might be relevant to you. This was a randomized double blind placebo controlled double crossover study, this was done as an outpatient study. So the kids weren't in a hospital, they were living out in the world. This again was done on younger kids. So this was six to six to 13 year old kids that were diagnosed with ADHD. They received either acetyl L-carnitine or placebo, and they did all the good practice stuff that good researchers do of making sure that the placebo and the acetyl L-carnitine had similar look and taste. It was consumed twice daily after meals. I should just mentioned that acetyl L-carnitine typically is taken in capsule form or occasionally an injectable form. Here, they they were using this as a drink, which essentially the same as capsule form, but the powders just going directly into liquid and the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram. So they're doing this according to the body weight of these kids with a maximum dosage of four grams per day, the quantity of the medication was supplied here. I'm reading for a period of eight weeks and every eight weeks a new quantity of medication was supplied. So basically this is a fairly long term study, exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes in week eight, 16 and 24. They also looked at blood things that you could only get through a blood draw, so things like hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, et cetera, they, these are kids and even if it were adults, they were quite appropriately examining a lot of the physiological measures that one would want to carry out to make sure, first of all, that blood levels of carnitine are increasing. And indeed they confirmed that, but also that no negative effects are showing up in the physiology as well as the psychology of these kids. So, first I'll just tell you the basic outcome of the study, which was, here I'm paraphrasing, \"Here, given twice daily, carnitine appeared to be effective and well tolerated treatment for a group of children with ADHD.\" \"They showed significant, the abnormal behavior compared to these other boys.\" And now I'm moving to the table of results. They showed significant reductions in their so-called \"Total Problem Score.\" The total problem score is a well-established measure of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD. And I should say adults with ADHD, has to do with challenges in social and learning environments and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform. Reductions in intentional problems, overall reductions in delinquency, and most important for sake of today's discussion, significant reductions in aggressive behavior. Now what's especially nice about this study, I think, is that even though it's a relatively small number of subjects and certainly needs to be repeated in other studies and other laboratories, that they were able to confirm the shifts in L-carnitine within the bloodstream of these kids, that is they were able to correlate the physiology with the psychological changes, in studies like this. And frankly in all studies of human pharmacology, you have to worry about effects that show up, not just because of placebo effects, but because of so-called off target effects or related things, totally independent of the drug or the particular supplement that you happen to be looking at, to put in the words of a great neuroscientist. Unfortunately, he passed away some years ago, but he was a member of the national academy, extremely accomplished neuroscientist once turned to me and said, \"Never forget a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or a human being creates a paper,\" meaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug or any supplement in most all conditions. However, it is in cases such as this study, where you can quite convincingly see that the particular feature of physiology that you expected to change, actually changed. And you see a psychological outcome that you can gain much greater confidence that the changes in delinquency, in this case reduced delinquency, improved attention, reduced aggressiveness and so forth was at least somehow related to the shift in blood physiology and levels of L-carnitine or acetyl L-carnitine and carnitine in the bloodstream of these children, as opposed to something else like L-carnitine going and affecting some downstream target that you have no knowledge of. Now, of course that's still entirely possible, but I think studies such as these increase our confidence that things like L-carnitine can be used perhaps in concert with things like omega 3 supplementation, diets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan and therefore more serotonin, obviously avoiding things like alcohol and as it appears from the study I just described, reducing one's intake or not consuming any caffeinated alcoholic beverages seems like it would be a good idea if your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, to think about the hormone context and whether or not you tend to have higher testosterone, an estrogen or lower testosterone, an estrogen, maybe even think about the work environment, whether or not you are existing in a particularly competitive work environment and even day life, time of year and whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight, whether or not you're avoiding light in the evening and so on. So studies such as this I think are useful because they point to the fact that very seldom, if ever, will there be one supplement or one nutritional change or even one behavioral change, that's going to completely shift in individual from being aggressive and impulsive, but rather that by combining different behavioral regimens, by paying attention to things like time of year and work conditions and school conditions and overall levels of stress and likely therefore levels of cortisol, et cetera, that you can use behaviors, diet, and supplementation as a way to shift that overall internal milieu from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure as it's been called throughout the episode toward aggressive impulsivity and relax some of that hydraulic pressure and reduce aggressive tendencies. So once again, and frankly, as always, we've done a deep dive into the neurobiology and the psychology of what I believe to be an important feature of our lives, in this case aggression. I want to point out that in a episode in the not too distant future, I'm going to be hosting Dr. Professor David Anderson from Caltech University, who is the world expert on the neurobiology of aggression. In fact, he is the senior author on many of the studies related to the ventromedial hypothalamus that I discussed today. Our discussion will touch on aggression, of course. So hearing today's episode will help you digest that information, but we are also going to talk about other emotional states. He is an expert, not just in aggression, but in motivated states related to sex and mating behavior, social relationships of all kinds and how those relate, not just to biology and psychology, but also certain forms of pathology, things like PTSD and the relationship for instance, between anger, fear, anxiety, and depression, and many other important topics that I know many of you, if not all of you will be interested in. In the meantime, I want to point you to his recently released and wonderful book entitled, \"The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.\" And again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech. This is a wonderful book. It serves as a tremendous introduction to the history of the study of these areas, the current science and discoveries being made in these areas, all made accessible to the scientist and non-scientist alike. It's a very engaging read and so much so that even though he was gracious in sending me a copy, I also purchased myself a copy to give to somebody who is a therapist, and I've purchased another copy to give to a high school kid that I mentor because he's very interested in the neuroscience of emotions. And I think we are all interested in emotions, not just fear and some of these negative states, not just aggression, but also the positive emotions of our lives. And so, \"The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us,\" by David Anderson is a wonderful read. I can't recommend it highly enough.

During today's episode and on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them, for things like improving the transition time and the quality of your sleep and improving alertness and focus. And so on. Anytime you're considering taking supplements, there are several key considerations. First of all, those supplements should be of the very highest quality. And you want to make sure that what's listed on the bottle is actually what's in the bottle, which is a problem for any supplement companies out there. The Huberman Lab Podcast is pleased to announce that we are now partnered with Momentous supplements because we believe Momentous supplements to be of the very highest quality of any supplements out there. And we've been working very closely with them in order to direct them, to create supplements that are individual ingredient supplements of the particular quality and sources that we would like to see, and that relate to the science and studies covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast. If you'd like to see some of those supplements, you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman, and there you'll see some of the supplements that we've talked about on this podcast before such as magnesium threonate for augmenting sleep, things like L-tyrosine for augmenting dopamine and things like L-carnitine, which we've discussed on today's podcast. Right now, the list of supplements and the products that are there is only partial to what will soon be included in the future. So that's an ever expanding catalog of, again, what we believe to be the very highest quality supplements available to you. For those of you that are interested in behavioral, nutritional and supplementation based tools for neuroscience and other aspects of your biology, the impact, your health and performance, we have a newsletter. It is a zero cost newsletter. It's called \"The Neural Network Newsletter.\" You can go to hubermanlab.com and there in the menu, you'll find \"The Neural Network Newsletter\" sign-up. You can just put your email. We do not share your email with anybody else. You will also find examples of the newsletter that you can download right away without having to sign up and decide if signing up is right for you. And if you're not already following us on Twitter an Instagram, we are Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter. And at both places, I describe science and science based tools, some of which overlaps with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast. Once again, thank you for joining me for our discussion about the biology, psychology and actionable tools around aggression, and as always, thank you for your interest in science.

    "summary": "Today, we are discussing aggression. I'm going to explain to you that there are several different types of aggression, for instance, reactive aggression versus proactive aggression. There's also proactive aggression where people go out of their way to deliberately try and harm others. It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms underlying each of the different types of aggression. I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression. Talk about some of the hormones and peptides and neurotransmitters involved. Now, right here at the outset, I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression has to have an element of context within it. Later I'll talk about neural circuits in the brain and body that reinforce, in other words, reward through the release of chemicals that make people feel good. Acts of aggression. And yes, that can make you feel more aggressive. So today's discussion will include a description of aggression in the pathological sense. And we'll talk about verbal aggression, physical aggression, proactive aggression, as mentioned before, and reactive aggression.\n",

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode is about the biology, psychology and practices of social bonding. From the day we are born until the day we die, the quality of our social bonds dictates much of our quality of life. It should therefore be no surprise that our brain, and indeed much of our entire nervous system is wired for social bonds. Now social bonds occur between infant and parent, there even particular wiring diagrams within the brain and spinal cord and body that are oriented towards the specific bonds that occur between infant and mother, as well as infant and father. And we have specific brain circuitries for friendship, specific brain circuitries that are activated in romantic relationships. And as it goes, specific brain circuitries that are activated when we break up with a romantic partner or when they break up with us, or when somebody passes away, moves away, or otherwise leaves our lives in one form or another. Today, we are going to talk about those brain and nervous system circuitries, we're also going to talk about the neurochemicals and hormones that underlie their function. And we are going to touch on a number of important and actionable tools that you can apply in everyday life. And because we are headed into the holiday, the New Year and Christmas holiday, that you can deploy in your various interactions with family members and friends. And should you not be spending time with family members and friends, today, we are also going to talk about how to achieve social bonds out of the context of family and romantic partnership and friendship. So today's episode is going to include a lot of science, a lot of actionable tools, and I'm confident that you will come away from today's episode with tremendous knowledge about how you function. For instance, if you're an introvert or an extrovert, why is that? Turns out there may be a neurochemical basis for that. Maybe you're somebody that really enjoys social media, maybe you're somebody that doesn't. Today I'm going to talk about a gene or a set of genes that predicts whether or not you will follow more people or seek out more online, social interactions or fewer. Believe it or not, there's biology around that now, and it's excellent peer reviewed work. We will also talk about how bonds are broken, and why breakups can be so painful, not just romantic breakups, but breakups with friendships and coworkers, and how to move through those more seamlessly. So regardless of your age, and regardless of whether or not you are in a romantic partnership of one form or another, or not, I do believe this episode will be useful to you as you explore the social bonds that already exist in your life, and as you seek out new and changing social bonds. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roka. Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, and the visual system has many important features that allow us, for instance, to see things with crystal clarity, even if it's brightly lit or dimly lit, or there are changing brightness in our environment. Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed with the biology of the visual system in mind. So when you wear them, you don't have to take them off and put them back on like you would with other types of sunglasses and eyeglasses, and you're always going to see things with crystal clarity. In addition, they're very lightweight, so usually forget that you're wearing them. I certainly forget when I'm wearing mine. I wear readers at night and when I drive, and I wear sunglasses often throughout the day. The other thing that's really great about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses is that you can wear them doing anything. You can wear them while running, while cycling, if you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face. But unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there, they have a terrific aesthetic that you could also wear to work, to school, out to dinner, they basically can be worn anywhere, anytime. If you'd like to try Roka, eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to Roka that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman at checkout to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012, and I've taken it ever since. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason that I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day, is because it covers all of my vitamin mineral probiotic foundational needs. There's now a wealth of evidence pointing to the fact that vitamins minerals and probiotics support healthy gut microbiome, healthy immune system, healthy nervous system, healthy endocrine system, that's the hormone system. And with Athletic Greens, it really covers all those bases. In fact, when people ask me what one supplement they should take, I recommend Athletic Greens. If you like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you can claim a special offer. They're giving five free travel packs, which make it very easy to mix up the Athletic Greens while on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera, plus a year supply of vitamin D3/K2. There is now a lot of evidence supporting that Vitamin D3 is great for our metabolism endocrine system, mood sleep, a huge number of biological functions. And K2 has also been shown to be important for cardiovascular health and various aspects of blood lipids. So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you can claim a special offer, you'll get your Athletic Greens, five free travel packs of Athletic Greens, plus a year supply of vitamin D3/K2. Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app supported by 25 published studies and has over 600,000 five-star reviews. I've been meditating for a very long time, more than three decades, but I confess I haven't been a consistent meditator until recently. I think many people will have that experience, we've all heard about the terrific science and benefits of a regular meditation practice. Things like reduced anxiety, improved sleep, sharper cognition, and focus. However, sticking to a meditation practice can be tricky, and many people start and then they stop. Or at least that's what happened to me until a few years ago, when I started using the Headspace app to do my meditation. Headspace has short meditations of just a couple minutes long, longer meditations. Ideally for me, I like to do a 20-minute meditation at least three times a week, but sometimes because of my schedule and other things going on, I only sneak in a five-minute meditation once or twice a week. With Headspace, you have a huge number of meditations to select from. So if you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get a completely free one-month trial with all of Headspace's meditation. That's the full library of meditations that Headspace has to offer. That's the best deal offer by Headspace right now. So again, if you're interested, go to headspace.com/special offer today. Let's talk about the biology of social bonding. And I want to point out that I used the word bonding intentionally. It's a verb. And in biology, we want to think about verbs because everything in biology is a process, it's not an event. And when we think about things in biology as a process, that means it's going to have multiple steps. And today we are going to explore the steps, start to finish of social bonding. Meaning how social bonds are established, how they are maintained, how they are broken and how they are reestablished. Now an important feature of biology generally, but in particular, as it relates to social bonding, is that the neural circuits meaning the brain areas and neurons and the hormones, things like oxytocin, which we'll talk about today, and the other chemicals in the brain and body that are responsible for the process we call social bonding are not unique to particular social bonds, they are generic. What I mean by that is that the same brain circuits that are responsible for establishing a bond between parent and child are actually repurposed in romantic relationships. And this might not come as a surprise to many of you, many of you are probably familiar with this idea of securely attached people versus anxious attached people versus avoidant attached people. We're going to touch on that a little bit, but all of that has roots in whether or not children and parents formed healthy social bonds, or whether or not they had challenged social bonds. Now it's clear from the scientific and psychological literature that just because you might have had a not so great or even terrible social bond with a parent or with some other caretaker or loved one as a child, that doesn't fate you to have poor social bonds as an adult, there's a lot of plasticity in the system, meaning it can change, it can rewire in response to experience. And as we will soon discover, there specific components within the neural circuits of your brain that are responsible for social bonding that allow you to place subjective labels on why you are doing certain things and to rewire the neural circuits for social bonding. So we're going to touch on all of that today. But the important feature really to point out is that we don't have 12 different circuits in the brain and body for different types of social bonds, we have one, and there's some universal features that underlie all forms of social bonds. So we're going to start by exploring what those neural circuits are, and then we're going to see how they plug into different types of social bonds. And then we're going to explore things like introversion, extroversion, where we're going to touch on a little bit about things like trauma bonds, healthy bonds, and various other aspects of how humans can bond to one another. And as you'll soon discover, there is a unique chemical signature of all bonding of all kinds. And you're going to learn how to modulate that chemical signature. Before we talk about social bonding, I want to talk about it's mirror image, which is lack of social bonding or social isolation. Now for better, for worse, there is a tremendous literature on the biology of social isolation, and all of the terrible things that happen when animals or humans are socially isolated at particular phases of life. Now, for those of you that are introverts, you are not necessarily damaging yourself by deciding to spend less time with other people. Many people like time alone, I personally am an introvert, I get a thrill out of spending time with one or two close friends, but I enjoy a lot of time by myself. I like to socialize, so I wouldn't call myself an extreme introvert, but I know there's some extreme introverts out there. But when we talk about social isolation, what we're referring to is when animals or humans are restricted from having the social contacts that they would prefer to have. And to just briefly touch on the major takeaways from this literature, which spans back a hundred years or more, being socially isolated is stressful. And one of the hallmark features of social isolation is chronically elevated stress hormones, like adrenaline also called epinephrin, like cortisol, a stress hormone that at healthy levels is good for combating inflammation, helps us have energy early in the day, focused throughout the day. But if cortisol is elevated for too long, which is the consequence of social isolation, the immune system suffers and other chemicals start to be released in the brain and body that are designed to motivate the organism, animal or human to seek out social bonds. An example of one such chemical is a peptide called tachykinin. Tachykinin is present in flies, in mice and in humans, and under conditions of social isolation, it's levels go up, and because of the brain areas that contain receptors for tachykinin, people start feeling very aggressive and irritable after social isolation. Now that should be a little bit counterintuitive to you, you would think, oh, you know, if you isolate an animal or a human, and then you give them the opportunity for social interaction, they should behave very well, they should be thrilled, they're finally getting the nourishment, the social nourishment that they've been lacking for so long. It turns out that's not the case. Chronic social isolation changes the nature of the brain and body such that it makes social connection harder, and it makes the person who's been isolated, irritable, even aggressive with other people. Now, I don't want to go too deeply into the biology of social isolation, because it doesn't actually afford us that much insight into what healthy social bonding looks like. So today we're going to focus more on the functional biology, a dual meaning of the word functional, as opposed to the pathology of social isolation. However, I do want to point out that social isolation starts to deteriorate certain aspects of brain and body pretty quickly, but how quickly depends again on how introverted or extroverted somebody is. So if you're somebody who is socially isolated for the holidays, or has been socially isolated for a period of time, and is craving social contact, that is a healthy craving. And as we'll learn next, the healthy craving for social contact has a very specific brain circuit, has a very specific neurochemical signature associated with it, and has some remarkable features that you can leverage in social contacts of all kinds. I think some of the more important and exciting work on social bonding comes from the laboratory of Kay Tye. Kay is a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, she's an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. And in recent years, I would say in about the last five or six years, her laboratory has made a fundamental discovery as to why we seek out and put so much effort into social bonds. And the key discovery that she made is that much like hunger, much like temperature, much like thirst, we have brain circuits that are devoted to what's called a social homeostasis. Many of you have probably heard about homeostasis before, homeostasis is the characteristic of various biological circuits and even individual cells to try and maintain a certain level. It's most easily thought of in the context of hunger, if you don't eat for a while, your drive to pursue food and think about food and make food and spend money on food, and indeed to enjoy food goes up. Whereas when you're well fed, you don't tend to seek out food with as much vigor or as much intensity, you wouldn't invest as much time, effort, money, et cetera. So homeostasis is the aspect of cells, tissues, and organisms to seek some sort of balance to regulate themselves. In a crude way, you can think about the thermostat on your home as a homeostatic circuit. When the temperature goes up a little bit, it cools things down to maintain a certain temperature. When the room gets cold, it hits a certain level and a sensor detects that, it clicks on and then the heat goes on to maintain a certain set temperature. So that's a simple way of thinking about homeostasis. Every homeostatic circuit has three components, or at least three, one is a detector, meaning the organism or the thermostat on your wall has to have some way of detecting what's going on in the environment, all right, in the context of social bonding, whether or not you are interacting with others and whether or not those interactions are going well. So that has to be detected, that's the first thing. Then there has to be a control center, that's the second thing. And the control center is the one that makes the adjustments to, in the case of social bonding, to your behavior and to your psychology. So you'll soon learn that there are ways in which the more time that you spend alone, the more motivated you are to seek out the pictures of faces, the interactions with actual people, physical contact, and so forth. Now that might seem obvious to you, but thanks to the work of Kay Tye and others, it's remarkable to learn that there are specific brain centers that are adjusting our psychology and biology so that we seek out bonds more aggressively, or maybe we don't because we are perfectly sated or satiated with respect to how much contact we've had with other people. Now, the third component of this homeostatic circuit is the effector. The effector is actually what drives the behavioral response, it's what leads you to pick up your social media and start scrolling, it's what leads you to text a friend, it's what leads you to call a friend or make plans and what leads you to follow through on those plans. So again, those three components are a detector, a control center, and an effector. And as you'll soon learn, the neural circuit that controls the social homeostasis actually has a fourth component, and that fourth component is one that places subjective understanding as to why you are doing what you are doing, and establishes your place in a hierarchy. Now, I know the word hierarchy can be a little bit of a barbed wire one because people immediately start thinking about boss and subordinate, or in couples, a leader and a follower. But when we talk about social hierarchies in the context of human interactions, social hierarchies are very plastic, meaning in one setting, one person can be the leader, in another setting, the other person can be the leader. You probably have groups of friends or family members where you're constantly passing the baton as to who's going to drive, who's going to navigate, who's going to pick the restaurant, who's going to clear the dishes and who's going to do certain activities and not others. So hierarchies are very dynamic. And as a consequence, social has to be very plastic and very fluid so that you move from one environment to the next, even with the same people, you have to be able to make those adjustments. And in the case of the social homeostasis circuit, those adjustments are made by a particular brain structure, I've talked about on this podcast before, it's called the prefrontal cortex, it is the seat of our higher consciousness, if you will. It's what allows us to play subjective labels on things so we are not strictly input output, we're not robotic. Meaning if you go to dinner with a friend and they are exceptional at choosing restaurants, well, in the context of the social homeostasis circuit, your prefrontal cortex would allow them to pick the restaurant because basically they are dominant over you in their capacity to pick good restaurants, at least in this example. Whereas as you leave that restaurant and perhaps you are navigating to a where to get a drink after dinner, or where to walk through the city, perhaps you have the better sense of direction. And so then the social bonding has to be maintained as you switch the hierarchy, okay? So that's the role of that fourth element, the prefrontal cortex. Now I just briefly want to touch on some of the brain areas that thanks to the work of Kay Tye and others, we now know underlie the detection, control and response. Okay, I call them the detector, control center and effector because inside of that description, isn't just a bunch of names of neural structures, there are also hints as to what the underlying neurochemicals are, and by understanding what the neurochemicals are, you can start to think about tools that you can use to form social bonds and maintain social bonds in better, healthier ways. So let's talk about the detector first. Now, keep in mind that you have your senses, you have your vision, you have your hearing, you have touch, you have smell, you have taste. Sensation as I've talked about many times before in the podcast, but I'll just remind you, sensation is the conversion of physical stimuli in the environment into electrical and chemical signals in your nervous system. The language of the nervous system is electrical and chemical signals. So photons of light are converted to electrical and chemical signals, pressure on the skin or light touch on the skin is converted into electrical and chemical signals and so on and so forth. So all of that of course is flowing into the nervous system, but the detector that underlies social homeostasis involves mainly two structures, one is called the ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the other is the BLA, basal lateral amygdala. And when you hear the word amygdala, you're probably thinking fear. But today, as you'll see, the amygdala actually has many different sub compartments and components. And there's a reason why the basal lateral amygdala, which is associated with certain aspects of aversive behaviors, meaning moving away from certain types of things or interactions, there's a reason why the BLA is such an integral part of the detector system, and that's because just as it's important to form healthy social bonds, it's vitally important to try and avoid unhealthy social bonds. And so the basolateral amygdala is mainly associated with these aversive type responses of just moving away from certain things. The control center in the social homeostasis circuit involves a brain area called the lateral hypothalamus and the periventricular hypothalamus. The lateral hypothalamus and the periventricular hypothalamus contain neurons that are able to access the hormone system in order to influence the release of things like oxytocin, which is a hormone neuropeptide, it's got a part hormone, part neurotransmitter, it's kind of a hybrid, we're going to talk a lot about oxytocin today. So we've got the ACC and the BLA, these are their areas are mainly involved in moving away from things, although also toward them, that's the detector. Then we got the control center, which is in the hypothalamus, and then there's a very special and important area associated with social bonding that I want everyone to learn, which is the dorsal raphe nucleus or DRN, dorsal raphe nucleus. The dorsal raphe nucleus is a small collection of neurons in the midbrain, so it's deep in the brain. And most of the time when you hear about raphe, R-A-P-H-E, by the way, raphe nucleus, you're talking about serotonin. Serotonin is a neuromodulator that is often associated with feelings of satiety after eating, warmth, basically satisfaction with things that you already have. However, within this dorsal raphe nucleus, there is a small subset of neurons that release dopamine. Dopamine is a neuromodulator most often associated with movement, craving, motivation and desire. And the neural circuits that are rich with dopamine are things like the substantia nigra, the mesolimbic dopamine system, the VTA, the nucleus accumbens, et cetera. Those names don't have to mean anything to you. However, this unique population of dopamine neurons in the raphe is truly unique in that it's responsible for mediating what I've been calling social homeostasis. It is the effector or the response that mediate social homeostasis. Now I haven't told you exactly what social homeostasis is. Social homeostasis, just like hunger, is the process by which when you lack social interaction, you start to crave it. What's very interesting about the fact that there are dopamine neurons in this raphe structure that is the effector for social homeostasis, what this means is that when you are not interacting with people at a frequency or intensity, that is right for you, dopamine is released into the brain. In most popular conversations about dopamine, and even in scientific circles, when you hear dopamine release, you think about reward or feeling good, because indeed many behaviors and drugs of abuse increase dopamine. That's one of the reasons they have so much addictive potential. However, dopamine is not associated with feeling good, it is actually the neurochemical that's responsible for movement toward things that feel good. So to zoom out and conceptualize what we have here, we have a brain area that is a detector that either will move us toward or away from certain types of experiences or sensations. We have a control center that is going to release certain hormones and neuropeptides into our brain and blood, depending on the sorts of interactions that we happen to be having. And we have this response system, which is the dorsal raphe nucleus that contains dopamine neurons. And when we are not interacting with people at the frequency or intensity that we crave, dopamine is released, and that dopamine causes us to seek out social interactions of particular kinds. So let's talk about what social homeostasis is and how it plays out. And again, let's use hunger as an example. So let's say you're a person who eats every three or four hours regularly. So on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, you're just accustomed to eating every three or four hours. If just suddenly I steal your meal out of the fridge at work, something I would not do, but just for sake of mental experimentation, that would probably cause you to go and seek out food through some other route. You might buy food, you probably be upset first, but then you go buy food or replace the food that you were going to eat, you'd be hungry for that food. And indeed there are hormonal type mechanisms and other mechanisms that when we eat regularly and we predict that food is coming in, we actually start secreting insulin, which is for mobilizing blood sugar, there are hormones in the bloodstream that make us hungry on a regular clock-like schedule, and you would seek out more food. Similarly, if you're somebody who is accustomed to a lot of social interaction, and suddenly I take away that social interaction, you would feel kind of let down, you would crave a replacement social interaction. You might be upset that you had a lunch date with a friend, you're used to having lunch with them every Wednesday, and they cancel and you would crave the interaction. Okay, this is called a pro-social craving. And indeed, this is what you see in animals and humans. If you, what's called acutely isolate them, which is just a fancy scientific word of saying deprive them of social interactions in a short-term basis, they start engaging in pro-social behaviors, they start texting other people, they start seeking out social interactions of different kinds. And that makes perfect sense, right? But thought of from the different side, you could also imagine how well, if you're getting a social interaction with somebody on a daily or weekly basis, and suddenly you remove that interaction, well, then people might not care, they might just think, well, I'll get the interaction tomorrow or the next day or the next day, because they're sated, much in the same way that the person who eats very regularly might say, \"Well, I ate four hours ago, and I'll eat eight hours later, no big deal.\" But that's not what happens. There's a prediction that we are going to have certain types of interactions, and when those interactions don't happen, we replace that lack of interaction with a drive and a motivation to seek out social interaction. And that drive and motivation is caused by, or I should say, is driven by dopamine release from that dorsal raphe. And so the takeaway is that when we lack social interaction that we expect, we become pro-social. However, if we are chronically socially isolated, meaning we don't have interactions with people for a long time, we become actually more introverted. This is separate from all of the tachykinin stuff that I talked about earlier, or falling into states of chronic stress, but it's well-established now that in humans and in animals, if you don't give them enough social interaction, they actually become antisocial. And so this is actually a little bit like what one might see with long-term fasting. Okay, I gave the example of eating every four hours, now let's give the parallel example of somebody who's been fasting perhaps for two or three days, if they are expecting to eat, and then the meal doesn't arrive, they are not necessarily going to immediately try and seek out food. And that's a little bit counterintuitive, you would have thought, well, they haven't eaten in a very long time, they're going to be very motivated to seek out food, but no, they are accustomed to fasting. Similarly, the social homeostasis circuit works in a way such that when we don't have social interactions for a very long time, we start to lose our craving for social interactions. Let's look at the social homeostasis circuit through the lens of what's commonly called introversion and extroversion. Now, typically when we hear about introverts, we think about the quiet person at the party, or the person that doesn't want to go out at all. And we think about an extrovert as somebody who's really social, the so-called social butterfly, who enjoys social interactions, is really chatty, is kind of life of the party type person. That's the cliche or the kind of pop psychology cliche, but actually in the psychology literature, that's not really the way it holds up. Many people who appear introverted are actually extroverted. The quiet person at a party could be an extrovert, except that they just don't talk very much. The characteristic of an extrovert is somebody that gets energy or feels good from social interactions, they sort of get a lift, and we can predict that that lift occurs because of some release of dopamine within their brain and body. And indeed there's evidence for that, neuroimaging study support that, other forms of neuro-biological analysis support that as well. We can also imagine that the person who's talking a lot is somebody who's very extroverted, but oftentimes people who talk a lot for their work or they're somebody who's very social when you interact with them, that person gets back to their car and is absolutely depleted and exhausted by that interaction or all sorts of social interactions. So we really can't predict whether or not somebody is an introvert or an extrovert simply based on their behavior, it's really more of an internal subjective label. However, if we look at introversion and extroversion through this lens of the social homeostatic set point, and we think about dopamine as this molecule that drives motivation to seek out social interactions, what we can reasonably assume is that introverts are people that when they engage in certain forms of social interaction, either the amount of dopamine that's released is greater than it is an extrovert, that's right, I said greater than it is at an extrovert, and so they actually feel quite motivated, but also satisfied by very brief, or we could say sort of sparse social interactions. They don't need a lot of social engagement to feel sated. Again, the parallel example would be hunger. This would be somebody who doesn't need to eat much in order to feel satisfied. Whereas the extrovert, we can reasonably assume releases less dopamine in response to an individual social interaction. And so they need much more social interaction in order to feel filled up by that interaction. And indeed this is supported by the neuro-biological imaging studies. So rather than thinking about introverts and extroverts as chatty versus quiet, it's useful to think about people, maybe yourself, maybe other people you know, as how much social interaction they need in order to bring this social homeostasis into balance. Now there's the fourth component of this social homeostasis circuit that I mentioned before, and that's the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is involved in thinking and planning and action, and has extensive connections with areas of the brain like the hypothalamus, which is responsible for a lot of motivated drives. It also has connections with the various reward centers of the brain, and it can act as kind of an accelerator, meaning it can encourage more electrical activity of other brain centers, or as a break on those brain centers. A really good example, it's kind of a trivial one in the context of today's discussion, but it's a concrete one so I'll use it, it would be, I know many people out there use cold showers as a way to stimulate metabolism and build up resilience and this sort of thing. If you get into a very cold shower and you feel as if you want to get out, but you force yourself to stay in, you're forcing yourself to stay in because your prefrontal cortex is placing some subjective label on that experience. Either you're doing it for a certain benefit or you've got a timer, and you're using the timer as the regulator of how long you're going to stay in, basically your overriding reflexes. And that's the main function of the prefrontal cortex. But as I mentioned earlier, the prefrontal cortex components that wire into the social homeostasis circuit are responsible for evaluating where you are in a given hierarchy. And that affords you a ton of flexibility in terms of the types of social interactions that you can engage in, and whether or not you're going to spend time with certain people or not, whether or not you're going to engage and then disengage. What do I mean by this? Well, let's say you're an extroverted person, you're somebody that likes a lot of social interaction and you get a lot of dopamine release on whole from a lot of social interactions. So maybe one interaction with a teller at the supermarket, isn't really going to give you much dopamine, but going to a party will give you more dopamine, and so you seek out these larger social interactions. However, you might go to a party where somebody says something or you see somebody there that you'd much prefer not to see, and therefore you decide to leave. The deciding to leave is regulated by that prefrontal cortex component. So it's important to understand that just because there's a homeostatic circuit that involves areas like the amygdala and the hypothalamus and these deep brain regions, like the dorsal raphe, as a human being, you have flexibility over your social interactions and that flexibility arise from those prefrontal circuits. So there's a ton of subjective nature to it, there's a lot of context to it. So while there are some predictable elements of these circuits, they are not simply what we would call, plug and chug, you have flexibility, you are able to say, \"You know, I love parties, but I really don't want to go to that party because so-and-so is there.\" Or, \"I very much don't like going across town in traffic, but I'm going to do it today because a certain collection of people, or perhaps a certain individual will be at that particular party.\" And so the prefrontal cortex again, is what allows you that subjective ruling or ruling over what would otherwise just be reflexes. So now I'd like to drill a little bit deeper into this incredible neural structure that is the dorsal raphe nucleus and this small collection of neurons, the dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe because while it's a small collection, they are very powerful. Loneliness has been defined by the great psychologist, John Cacioppo, as the distress that results from discrepancies between ideal and perceive social relationships. Let me repeat that. Loneliness is not just being isolated, loneliness, as he defines it, is the distress that results from discrepancies between ideal and perceive social relationships. It's when we expect things to be one way, and they're actually another way and which way we expect them to be and which way they turn out, again, is highly subjective. What you expect from friendships, and what other people expect from friendships could be entirely different, but the circuit that underlies friendship bonding is exactly the same. And it is this dorsal raphe nucleus and the dopamine neurons in that nucleus that underlie the bond that is social friendship and all types of social bonds. There's a key finding in the literature, the title of this paper is Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons Represent the Experience of Social Isolation. This is a paper from Kat Tye's lab, the first author is Matthews, Gillian Matthews to be specific. What they did is they were able to selectively activate the dopamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. And when they did that, they induced a loneliness-like state. Now, how did they know it was a loneliness-like state? They knew because it motivated the seeking out of social connections. This is the kind of social hunger that I was referring to before. Whereas when the dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe are inhibited, meaning their activity is quieted that suppressed a loneliness state. So that's a little counterintuitive, right? It's a group of neurons that when activated makes you feel lonely, and when this brain area is not activated, it suppresses loneliness. But if you think about it, that's exactly the kind of circuit that you would want in order to drive social behavior. When you're feeling lonely, dopamine is released and it causes you to go out and seek social interactions. When this brain area has enough social interactions, that's sort of a figure of speech, brain areas don't have enough social interactions, but when enough social interactions have happened, that the neurons in this brain areas shut down their production of dopamine. Well, the loneliness state turns off. So what we think of as loneliness as this big kind of dark cloud, or, you know, fog in our psychological landscape, boils down to a very small set of neurons, releasing a specific neurochemical for motivation. And to me, this really changes the way that we think about loneliness and that we think about social interactions. There's so much subjective landscape to loneliness and to social interactions, but at the end of the day, what it really is is that we are all social animals to some extent or another, and we all crave social interactions to some extent or another, although the extent will vary depending on where you are in the introversion extroversion continuum. And it is indeed a continuum. Now, the other aspect of the study that was really important gets back to that issue of hierarchy and social rank. What they found is that depending on where you see yourself in the social rank, the dopamine neurons in the raphe will lead to one consequence or another, meaning moving toward social interactions or moving away from them. So the whole system is set up so that you have a ton of flexibility and control over social interactions. So just a couple of key points and actionable takeaways based on the information I've offered up until now, if you think of yourself as an introvert, it's very likely that you get a lot of dopamine from a few or minimal social interactions. Whereas if you're an extrovert, contrary to what you might think, social interactions are not going to flood your system with dopamine, they actually are going to lead to less dopamine release than it would for an introvert, and therefore you're going to need a lot more social interactions in order to feel filled up by those interactions. Now I've been drawing a lot of parallels between this social seeking or avoiding social isolation and hunger, but is that really the case? And could it be that they're actually interactions between the different drives? Meaning could social isolation or the desire to seek out social interactions actually relate to the hunger system and vice versa? And indeed the answer is yes. We don't have 50 different homeostatic systems and 50 different neurochemicals to underlie our drive, to eat our drive for romantic interactions, our drive for friendship interactions, we have essentially one, maybe two, and they all funnel into the same dopamine system. And there's a beautiful paper that illustrates some of the crossover between these different homeostatic drives. The title of the paper is Acute Social Isolation Evokes Midbrain Craving Responses Similar to Hunger. This from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of technology, Dr. Kay Tye is also an author on this paper, the paper was published in Nature Neuroscience. It's a really terrific paper. Just to briefly summarize what they did, they took people that were categorized as socially connected healthy human adults. So these are people that are used to pretty frequent social interactions, and they socially isolated them for about 10 hours. And they had no opportunity to access social media, email, fiction reading even, and certainly didn't have the opportunity to interact with people face to face. So what this did is it increased social craving, both subjectively the people said that they were now craving social interactions, and then they did brain imaging in response to images of people, people interacting, food, flowers, other types of stimuli, some of the stimuli or these images that we call them stimuli but their images really, had a lot of social engagement going on in them, others did not, some had a lot of faces showing, others did not. And as you might suspect, there was activation of many of the brain areas that we've talked about earlier, dorsal raphe nucleus and other brain areas associated with dopaminergic neurons. When the socially isolated people viewed social cues, people interacting, faces, and so on and less so for things like flowers, however, they also had increased responses to images of food, which is interesting and actually is consistent with the literature that when people are socially isolated, they often will start eating more, or they will change the nature of the foods that they eat. Now we think of that as comfort foods or soothing oneself through eating rather than social interaction as a kind of pathology, but while it might not be healthy, depending on the context and the person, it's really important to understand that the reason that happens is because we have a common circuit and that the system meaning the person is actually craving dopamine release. They don't consciously know this, this is all subconsciously carried out, but they're craving dopamine release. And if they can't get it from social interactions, as they normally would, they'll start seeking it from food. Now they did an important reverse experiment as well, where they had subjects go on 10 hours of food fasting. Now these were not people that were familiar with fasting, they weren't doing intermittent fasting, they were eating more typical meal schedules, and so that created increased hunger, et cetera, but it also increased their appetite if you will, for social interactions. And so the important point here is that there's a common biology, there's a common circuitry that underlies homeostatic craving of things that maintain us as individuals and as a species. And it really places social interactions as right up there in the list of things that we could consider so vital for our survival and for our health. Things like food, water, social interactions really sit within a top tier amongst each other, and they use the same common circuitry, dorsal raphe dopamine neurons, in addition to other structures, in order to create this drive, to seek out certain types of stimuli. Now, this is a very reductionist view of social bonding, I realized that, but it's important to realize that while we place all the subjective context, oh, I miss this person, or I really would like to avoid that person, at the end of the day, it really all funnels into a system whereby a single neurochemical is either being released and motivating us to seek out more of a particular type of interaction or is not released, and therefore we are perfectly comfortable staying exactly where we are. As I say this, some of you are probably thinking, \"Oh, that's probably what happens when you fall in love.\" And indeed that's the case. When people enter romantic relationships, that to them are very satisfying, there's this period that, you know, that the theory is that it lasts anywhere from six days to six months, although some people report that this feeling can last many, many years, even decades of just feeling completely filled up and sated by the experience of being with that person. So much so that cravings for food are reduced, cravings for sleep are reduced. Now there's all sorts of activities and things that go along with new romantic partnerships that take up time, that might get in the way of things like sleep or things like food. But the point is that dopamine is the final common pathway by which we seek out things and we end up feeling as if we are satisfied by certain types of interactions. Now, similarly, if you've ever been isolated for a long period of time, your focus might have shifted to what you're going to eat, what you're going to cook for dinner in a much more heightened way, the importance of those sensory stimuli and those types of interactions, and indeed the taste of food itself expands. So normally when we are in social relationships that are ones that are familiar to us, we have a balance of these different drives. But when one particular drive takes over and we are very focused on it, because they all funnel into the same circuitry, there really isn't the seeking out of certain types of behaviors like food seeking when we're newly in love. Now that doesn't mean that food won't taste good to us so that we don't seek it. And indeed, there are experiments that have been done where if people have just fallen in love, the taste of a strawberry can just be incredible. The other effect of dopamine is that it changes the way that we interpret sensory stimuli, our detectors actually change when we are in heightened states of dopaminergic activity or drive. Basically what this means is that things seem better than they would when we have less dopamine in our system. The point here is that there's a lot of crossover, there's a lot of meshing together of different homeostatic drives that they don't exist in separate channels. And it's only under conditions in which one particular homeostatic drive is kind of being played out to the extreme, such as the example of falling in love, that we tend to avoid or sort of overlook the other homeostatic drives, and that's because simply we're getting enough dopamine, we don't need anymore. Up until now, I've been focused on the organizational logic of social bonding, which is really just nerd speak for how is it that we form bonds, avoid bonds? Why do people seek out more or fewer bonds than others, et cetera? Now I'd like to shift gears a bit, and focus on what are some things that we can do to encourage the formation of healthy bonds? There's a beautiful study that was published in Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. The title of this paper is Conscious Processing of Narrative Stimuli Synchronizes Heart Rate Between Individuals. I mentioned this on a previous podcast, but I'd like to mention it again and go into a little bit more depth because it points to specific actionable items that we can all use in order to enhance the quality and depth of social bonds of all kinds. Now this study involved a very simple type of experiment, they had people listen to a story, everybody in the study listened to the same story, but they listened to that story at different times and indeed in different locations. So different people, same story. And they measured things like heart rate, they measured breathing, et cetera. Now, what was the motivation for doing this? Well, there's a long standing literature showing that our physiology, things like our heart rate, our breathing, our skin conductance, meaning the amount of sweating, can be synchronized between individuals, and that synchronization can occur according to a variety of different things. There've been studies that have people look at one another and they look and actually see that their pupil size of their eyes starts to synchronize. People's breathing can synchronize, people's body temperatures can even start to synchronize, or at least shifts in body temperature can synchronize. One person gets cooler, the other person gets cooler. A lot of this is subconscious, some of it can be detected by conscious cues like flushing of the skin, or actually seeing someone's pupils change. But actually the pupil reflex is a really good example, whereby except for rare cases and certain highly trained individuals, most people can't control their pupil reflexes in a very deliberate way, it's truly a reflex, it's an autonomic reflex. So there's a lot of literature showing that within small groups or two people, these physiological signals can be synchronized. What this study found was that when people listen to the same story, but at different times, their heart rates start to synchronize. This is incredible because people are listening to the story at different times, but the gaps between their heartbeats become very stereotype and map almost precisely onto one another. That's incredible. Now we also know from an extensive literature that the quality and perceived depth of a social bond correlates very strongly with how much physiological synchronization there is between individuals. In other words, when your bodies feel the same, you tend to feel more bonded to somebody else. And so this whole thing is a rather circular argument, when you feel closer to somebody else, your physiology synchronize, and the reverse is true as well, when your physiologies are synchronized, you feel closer to other people. This is what I call the concert phenomenon, if you ever go to see your favorite band, or you go to a concert that you particularly love, you often look over at somebody and you'll see them enjoying the same thing, and they're often in a similar state as you are, maybe their sort of like favorite song comes on, and you actually feel connected to that person. You feel like you're in... Obviously there's a shared experience, but there's also a shared physiological response to that experience. And so this can happen and mass with large groups of people, or it can happen just between two individuals. And as the study points out, it can actually happen between individuals, without them actually interacting with one another. When the story they are listening to is the anchor or the driver of their physiology. This really points to the fact that the body and the brain are reciprocally connected. Yes, indeed, what we think, what we hear, what we feel drives our physiology, our heartbeat, our respiration, et cetera, but our heartbeat and respiration also are influencing our state of mind. And in this case, it's encouraging certain types of social bonds when our heart rates are synchronized. And you can leverage this, how can you leverage this? Well, let's take a upcoming example of the holidays. There's a sort of a joke, I think it was Ram Dass, sort of Buddhist philosopher type that said, \"If you think you're enlightened, go visit your parents.\" And I think what he was referring to is that some people, not all people, have challenging relationships with their parents. We're going to talk about child-parent attachment and interactions in a few minutes, but you know, some people have a wonderful relationship to both their parents and more power to them, I think that's wonderful, we should all be so lucky. Many people have challenged relationships with their parents, or they have a great relationship with their parents, but their parents know, or they know how to drive that dart right into that particular soft piece of psychological flesh by saying just the slightest thing, or even by raising their eyebrow or rolling their eyes or the tone in which they do something. This is also true between siblings. I think many of you can think of examples where this is true. Many people when they interact with others, expect that the mere interaction with the other person is going to create the sense of bonding. And often that is the case, for instance, if are involved in intimate disclosure, if people enjoy each other's company so much that just the mere sight of somebody evokes great feelings and it's mutual, that often can happen. But in many types of social interactions, it's not the direct interaction with that person that makes us feel close to them, but rather it's shared experience. And shared experience is shared physiology. That's the point I'm trying to make by way of this study about conscious processing of narrative stimuli synchronize this heart rate of different individuals. So for instance, if you have a somewhat challenged or somewhat, let's call it a slight friction in getting close with somebody, or it can be a challenging interaction, oftentimes, it's very useful to focus outward on some other common narrative, a movie, oftentimes people will watch a game together. Actually there's a lot of critique that people or families will focus outward too much on external events, but these external events can be observing the grandchild and how wonderful they are, or observing the meal and how wonderful it is. Or as we commonly see in various traditions, there's a story that's repeated each year, certainly in the upcoming holidays, there's Christmas stories, there are themes and traditions, and those themes and traditions anchor a number of different aspects of our psychology. They're really wonderful, they thread through the ages really, and allow us to link our own experiences up with previous generations and experiences. But in addition to that, they synchronize our physiologies. And so sometimes it can be useful rather than expecting others to shift our physiology in the way that we wish, or us shifting their physiologies in the way that we wish, and then expecting some bond to mushroom out of that in some beautiful way, to focus on some external stimulus, to focus on something that will synchronize the physiologies of both people, that can act as a bridge in order to establish social bonds. And this is not a hack or a workaround for making terrible relationships good, this is actually at the seat of what we come away from a social interaction with as feeling \"Wow, that was a really wonderful time.\" Often a really wonderful time can be by virtue of the specific things that were said, or the specific things that one engaged in, but more often than not the final common pathway, we should say, of great experiences was a great physiological experience and a shared physiological experience. I have a short anecdote that relates to this, I have an older sibling and she used to say that when she was in college, the best dates that she ever went on were dates where she was asked to go out and listen to music. She pointed out, however, that oftentimes the guys that would ask her out would take her to jazz clubs, she always had the theory that they would ask her to jazz clubs because at jazz clubs typically you would sit down and then she had to conclude that they couldn't dance. My sister likes to dance. And so anytime someone actually had the nerve to take her dancing, those turned out to be particularly, let's just say, satisfying dates and relationships, at least they lasted longer, that's all I know about them, that's all I want to know about them, she's my sister after all. But the theory behind whoever was asking her out on these dates was it was the right one, which is that if you want to bond with somebody, you create a common physiological response through a common and shared experience. And that is often a good entryway into establishing whether or not it's always a question, whether or not there can be common physiological experience between two individuals. Up until now, we've been talking about social bonding through the lens of neurocircuits that are already established. However, early in the episode, I mentioned that these very neural circuits that are responsible for social bonding in adult forms of attachment, be it romantic or friendship or otherwise are actually established during development. One of the more important, and I think exciting areas of early attachment as it relates to adult attachment, comes to us from the work of Allan Schore. Alan shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N, Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E is a psychoanalyst who also has deep understanding of neurobiology of attachment, both in childhood and in adulthood. And he's focused a lot on differences between right brain and left brain forms of attachment. Now in an early episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, I touched into the fact that most of what's discussed in the general public in sort of pop psychology and even in some neurobiology courses about right brain versus left brain, and one side of the brain being more emotional, and the other side being more rational is completely wrong. Okay, most of what I see out there is actually backwards to the way things actually work. And while there is some, what we call lateralization of function, meaning certain brain functions are handled by neurons on one side of the brain or the other, the idea that one side of your brain is emotional, and the other side of your brain is rational is just simply not true. However, the work of Allan Schore points to some very concrete neural circuits that do have a lateralization bias, meaning they are more right brain than left brain, or more left brain than right brain, that underlies certain forms of attachment between child and parents, in particular child and mother, and that these right brain-isms, if you will, and left brain-isms for attachment, get played out again and again in our forms of attachment as adults. So I'd like to talk about that work briefly now, because I think it really points to a number of important features of how we establish bonds and the different routes to establishing bonds. So within the field of psychoanalysis, there's been a longstanding discussion, of course, about the so-called unconscious or subconscious, the things that we are not aware of. And I think there's growing evidence pointing to the fact that at least one major component of the subconscious or the unconscious is the so-called autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the portion of our nervous system that controls our reflexive breathing, our heart rate, our skin conductance, meaning our sweating, pupil size, it's the aspect of our nervous system that makes us more alert or more calm. It's the so-called sympathetic, meaning for alertness, or parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic for more calming responses. Now what Dr. Schore's work and the work of others is now showing, is that early infant-parent, in particular infant-mother attachment involves a coordination or synchronization of these right brain circuits and these left brain circuits, as they relate, excuse me, to the autonomic nervous system. How does this play out? Well, it plays out where early on as an infant, when you're born, you're truly helpless, you can't feed yourself, you can't warm yourself, you can't change yourself, and you certainly can't emulate walk anywhere to get the things that you need. All of those functions, all of those needs rather are met by your primary caretaker. Typically that's the mother. Fathers of course play a role also, but because of breastfeeding or even bottle feeding, typically mothers play a more prominent role. I realized there are exceptions, but that's the general rule. There are now brain imaging studies examining the brains of infants and the brains of mothers as they interact and showing that the physical contact between the two, the breathing of the mother and child, the heart rate of the mother and child, and indeed the pupil size of the mother and child are actually actively getting coordinated. In other words, the mother is regulating the infant's autonomic nervous system primarily, and the infant is also regulating the mother's autonomic nervous system, a small coup from a baby or a cry, which is a stress cry from a baby will definitely regulate the autonomic nervous system of the mother. This whole right brain system is directly tapped into the so-called oxytocin system, and we'll talk more about oxytocin in a moment. Oxytocin again, being this peptide hormone that is involved in social bonds of all kinds, but that at least in early childhood is very closely associated with milk let down and milk production. There's actually a lot of stimulation of oxytocin release in the mother by nursing itself, so physical contact with the nipple, and by the contact of skin between baby and mother and their specificity there, it's not just any baby that can evoke the most amount of oxytocin release from the mother. Now, however, there are examples where just holding a child will evoke oxytocin release in the non-parent or somebody other than the parent, I think most people experience that. That's the new puppy or new baby phenomenon 'cause indeed puppies can invoke oxytocin release as well. The point is not that oxytocin is only released in response to the primary relationship, or the mother and their child, but rather that the amount of oxytocin scales with how closely related one is to that particular child and vice versa. So there's oxytocin release occurring in both the child and the mother. So this right brain system is an emotional but autonomic system, it is below our conscious detection. Now, as we get older, there's another system that starts to come into play in parent-child interactions, and this also comes into play in sibling interactions and so forth, and that's the left brain system as described by Allan Schore. Now, again, this isn't about emotion versus rationality, this is about autonomic versus more conscious forms of bonding. So on the left brain circuit side, there is evidence for based on neuroimaging studies, but also animal studies to support the idea that on the left brain side of things, there is a processing more of narratives that are very concrete, logical narratives, okay. And again, I have to zoom out and just really tamped down the idea that it's not that one side of the brain is emotional and the other side is rational, but rather that these two things are happening in parallel. And that there's a bit of a dominance for the left brain circuitry to be involved in the kinds of bonding that are associated with prediction and reward. So good example would be reading to a child every night, sitting there and reading, you know, I can recall reading to my niece and seeing her parents read to her. And she had no clue whatsoever with what they were saying because she, well, at least, I don't know, but she certainly couldn't speak, but she liked looking at the pictures, and it was a very predictable sort of interaction. It was okay, out come the books, it was usually here's the bath, then there's the pajamas, then there's the lights go down, then out comes the book, and then there's the interaction between parent and child, which of course usually also involves physical contact. So it's not like the right brain system and the left brain system are operating separately, they're operating in parallel. But that sort of prediction and reward kids like to be read to, is generally mediated by this left brain system. And this carries on as children get older and as parents take on and evolve their parenting roles. It's very apparent that healthy social bonding between children and caretaker relies on the fact that both this right brain system and the left brain system are engaged, that there's a synchronization of autonomic function, meaning a joining together in actual somatic feeling, and that there's a synchronization of experience that's more about some outward or external stimulus, like reading a book or watching a show together or enjoying some common experience of a meal together. And of course, as children get older, they're able to access more and more cognitively sophisticated things. You can watch a movie with them and they'll make predictions about which characters are going to show up for instance, or you can take to a concert and they can appreciate the concert or play in that concert, and they appreciate that they're being appreciated. Okay, so there are a million different, there's infinite number of examples here, but the idea is that there are two parallel circuits that are important for establishing bonds, and that this is set up very early on in childhood. And that it's neither emotional nor rational, but both. Now both of these circuits tap into the circuitry that we talked about earlier, where dopamine is released and molecules like serotonin, which again is a neuromodulator more associated with feelings of warmth, comfort, and satisfaction with our immediate surroundings and possessions rather than seeking of things and motivation and drive to go look for things, as is the case with dopamine. So there's still interactions with those systems, but the work of Allan Schore has stimulated a lot of interest in what are the circuits that underlie this autonomic bonding, this matching of heart rate and breathing, and what are the neural circuits that underlie this bonding or this synchronization of experience on the kind of left brain side. And the reason I find this model so attractive is that it's very clear that healthy child-parent bonds are established, but not by one or the other of these right brainer left brain systems, but by both. And there isn't enough time to go into it right now, but some of you are probably familiar with this idea of anxious attached versus avoidant attached versus there's a kind of dissociative attached model of infant parent bonding, just briefly. What's becoming clear from the neuro-biological imaging studies is that as people start to advance into adolescence and adulthood and well into their elderly years, the same circuits that were active and established in childhood are repurposed for other forms of attachment. And that to have truly complete bonds with other individuals, but in particular with romantic partners, it's important that there be both synchronization of physiology and synchronization of these more, I guess we could call them more rational or predictive type circuits. So we can leverage this information, we can start to think about what sorts of bonds to us feel very enriching and very complete. We know that we can have, for instance, an emotional connection with somebody, but we can also have a cognitive connection with somebody. I have many colleagues with whom I have deep intellectual connection and convergence with. I won't say that I have deep emotional connection with most of them, a few of them, yes, but most of them no. Others in my life, for instance, I have a deep emotional connection to, but not a lot of deep cognitive connection to. A good example would be the connection that I had with my bulldog, who unfortunately passed away. But Costello, we had a very close, emotional connection, right? It was based on touch, it was based on our walks, it was based on fun, it was very autonomic. We rarely discussed if ever what we were doing, we had a felt relationship as opposed to a cognitive relationship. And while I'm sort of half kidding about that, as an example, it's a really good example, it was a very real bond. And in fact, just as a brief anecdote, I can remember when Costello was a puppy and I was entirely responsible for his well-being, like any parent of any infant, I lost my appetite for those few weeks when I was house training him and I seem to lose all ability to process any cognitive information. Now I was also sleep deprived, but I was entirely focused on the autonomic bond that we were forming. And now, thankfully, that eventually was established pretty quickly. Basically I went on to just basically feed him, walk him and do everything for him, and we had a wonderful relationship. Now it's very clear that what we're talking about here is a form of empathy. Empathy is the ability to feel, or at least think we feel what others feel. Because again, as my colleague and the great bioengineer and psychiatrist at Stanford, Karl Deisseroth has said, and he was a guest on this podcast. We really don't know how other people feel, we just get the sense that perhaps we are feeling the same thing or we're feeling something different and we infer, or we project what they might be thinking. Empathy is this sense that we are sensing what other people are sensing, okay. And there's no real way to verify that except if you're measuring physiologies, you could get some insight into that. In the clinical psychology and in the neuro-biological literature now, it's understood that there is both emotional empathy, like actually feeling what somebody is feeling and what is now called cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy is this idea that we both see and experience something the same way at a mental level, emotional empathy is this idea that yes, I can feel what you feel at a visceral sematic or autonomic level. And it's absolutely clear that strong social bonds between children and caretaker involve both emotional empathy, this autonomic function and cognitive empathy, that there's a mutual understanding of how the other person feels and how the other person thinks in order to be able to make predictions about what they're going to do. It's also very clear based on the emerging literature, that romantic relationships, and to some extent, friendships, although friendships have been explored a bit less in the literature, that emotional empathy and cognitive empathy are both required in order to establish what we call a trusting social bond. And there's some beautiful experiments done using neuroimaging of two individuals playing a trust game, essentially a game where you're trying to predict the other person's behavior, whether or not they will behave in a trustworthy way. And these experiments tend to use real money, so there's actually something at stake, and you can more or less predict whether or not somebody feels a lot of trust for somebody else and whether or not they believe they will act in a trustworthy manner based on whether or not they have high levels of both cognitive empathy and emotional empathy. So for those of you that are seeking to establish deeper bonds or bonds of any kind, it's important that you think about synchronization of bodily states, we talked about that earlier, and synchronization of cognitive states. Now that doesn't mean you have to agree on everything. In fact, oftentimes people who feel very close to one another cognitively and emotionally argue about all sorts of things and disagree about a lot of things. In fact, we probably know, I certainly know people and couples that seem to bond through arguing, which is an interesting phenotype in itself. But the point isn't that there'd be total convergence of opinion or stance, but rather that we understand how the other feels and we believe that they understand how we feel, that we understand how the other person thinks and that they think that we understand how they think. So it's a reciprocal loop between two people that involves this cognition and involves emotion, and it's grounded as Dr. Schore has pointed out in our earliest forms of attachment. And that makes perfect sense because the same sorts of circuits that are responsible for social homeostasis, the kind of right brain and left brain circuits that are responsible for infant-mother attachment, and then later for more intellectual or predictive type attachments between child and caregiver, are the exact same circuits that we superimpose into all other types of relationships throughout the rest of our life. And I should just mention that for those of you that might be thinking that you had a less than satisfactory infant-caretaker interaction or form of attachment, you are not alone. And in fact, much of the work that Dr Schore focuses on is about how those early circumstances can be understood and rewired toward the development of healthy adult attachment. And if you want to check out his work, he's actually got a few YouTube videos out there, again, it's Allan Schore, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E, I'd love to get him as a guest on the podcast. He also has a book it's called \"Right Brain Psychotherapy.\" And it's an excellent book, it's actually pretty accessible even if you don't have a background in biology or psychology, I found it to be very interesting, there are a lot of excellent references. And again, if you're listening Dr. Schore or, you know, Allan Schore, we'd love to get you on the podcast. One of the key themes to understand about biological processes is that they often work on short timescales and longer timescales. And up until now, we've mainly been talking about the stuff that happens on short timescales. So the kind of synchronization of heart rate or activation of a given set of neurons that dumps some dopamine and causes us to seek out more social interaction or less for instance. But every biological circuit and function needs to have longstanding effects as well. And typically when you're thinking about longstanding effects in the brain and body, you start looking towards the hormone system. It's not always the case, but more often than not neuro-transmitters and neuromodulators are pretty quick, whereas hormones have longer lasting effects. In fact, a lot of hormones can actually travel to the nucleus of a cell and actually change which genes are expressed. So if ever there was a hormone or hormone-like molecule that's associated with social bonding, it's oxytocin, and oxytocin has gotten a ton of interest in the popular press. I don't know why that is, but perhaps it's because of all the incredible things that oxytocin is associated with. And it is indeed a lot of things. So for instance, oxytocin is released in the brain and binds to receptors in different locations in the body, and the moment you hear different locations in the body receptors, you should think, well, it's going to have lots of different effects. And indeed it does. Oxytocin is involved in orgasm, it's involved in social recognition. That's right, when you see people that you consider your people, your team, your group, your friends, oxytocin is released. Even if you don't come into physical contact with them. Oxytocin is also associated with pair bonding, the feeling that they are your person, and that you are their person, is the common language people use. It's also associated with honesty. Believe it or not, there are experiments that show that if people receive oxytocin through an inhalation spray, that they will be more honest and forthcoming about certain things. And the oxytocin system and variants in the oxytocin system have also been associated with autism and various autism spectrum disorders. So there's a huge range of behaviors that's involved in because you have receptors for oxytocin in lots of different brain structures and areas of the body that do different things. However, there's some very consistent effects of oxytocin that are worth just listing off, and then I'm going to talk about two separate pathways by which oxytocin can manifest its effects, and how you can actually regulate oxytocin in ways that are interesting and perhaps useful as well. First of all, oxytocin is involved in the milk, let down reflex, lactation. This makes perfect sense, there needs to be a cue by which the suckling on the nipple of the infant causes the release or let down of milk, and milk let down and lactation is controlled by prolactin, another hormone, but also oxytocin. Oxytocin is also involved in uterine contraction during childbirth, it's involved in cervical dilation to allow the baby to pass out of the birth canal. So it's involved in induction of breastfeeding and of labor, which is remarkable and especially remarkable given that in males or at least in some male animals and in some male humans, and I do want to say some, and I'll get back to this, it can be involved in the erection response, it can be involved in the orgasm response in both males and females. Although there there's a very interesting difference. There's a little bit of controversy about this, but it does appear that in females, sexual and orgasm cause the release of oxytocin, whereas in males, sexual stimulation does not cause the release of oxytocin, but rather a different molecule vasopressin is triggered by sexual stimulation, but orgasm does trigger the release of oxytocin in males, but with a delay of about 30 minutes. Why that is in the specific function of that is not clear, but it does seem the oxytocin is involved in the sexual response in both males and females. The main types of interactions that release oxytocin at high levels are first of all, that the interaction between individuals that see each other as very closely associated, right? So a infant and mother are very closely associated whether or not it's an adopted infant or not. Oftentimes they are in close contact, oftentimes they are from the very body of the other. And so the amount or the amplitude of oxytocin released tends to scale with how closely associated individuals are just the sight of one's baby or smell of one's baby can evoke oxytocin release and vice versa from the mother. Physical contact, even more so in romantic partners. Physical contact, even the sight of a picture of a partner can evoke oxytocin release and sexual desire also trust. So there's this whole collection of psychological and physiological things that are packaged into the oxytocin system. It's not just a one way system. Now, a lot of people out there have written to me asking about inhaling oxytocin, asking whether or not that can actually increase the depth or rate of pair bonding. And there does seem to be some evidence for that. Now, I think in most places, oxytocin is prescription, although it might be over-the-counter and others, I don't know, you have to check where you are as far as I know you can't just go out and buy oxytocin nasal spray, although you may be able to, forgive me, I'm naive to that point. But it's interesting to note that some drugs that are being used in clinical trials for things like trauma, and are also used in clinical therapeutic settings for increasing bonding, in particular MDMA, also called ecstasy, increase dopamine and serotonin, we know this, dopamine and serotonin have a vast number of effects throughout the brain and body that I've talked about some of them today and another podcast. But one of the lesser appreciated effects of MDMA is that it causes huge increases, massive increases in the amount of oxytocin that's released into the brain and body. And MDMA-assisted psychotherapy while still illegal, as far as I know, certainly in the United States, but in most places throughout the world, is being explored in clinical trials, not just for trauma, not just for depression, not just for eating disorders, but also for reestablishing what seemed to be fractured or challenged bonds between romantic partners. And while most of the attention has been focused on the dopaminergic and serotonergic aspects of the MDMA response, it's clear to me, based on my read of the literature, that the enormously elevated oxytocin that occurs during the consumption of MDMA is part of the reason why people experience during the MDMA session and post MDMA session, a much greater degree and depth of kinship or feeling of connection with that person. And it's important to point out that that feeling of connection is of the autonomic type that I was referring to earlier, al Allan Schore's work. That it's not of the, oh, we think about things the exact same way, we agree on everything now, it's more of that their physiologies are synchronized. So much so that even in individuals within a couple where one does a therapeutic session and the other does not, they still both feel quite more bonded to the other. Now, oftentimes in the clinical therapeutic setting, both members of a couple or romantic partnership, whatever form it may take or consuming MDMA and then thereby experiencing elevated oxytocin and this enhanced sense of bonding, and again, it's this autonomic bonding, but it's so powerful. Meaning the oxytocin response is so powerful that it doesn't even require that both individuals experienced this user inflection and oxytocin, and that's because one person's physiology is influencing the other, and oxytocin is this kind of bridging signal that occurs in both nervous systems, synchronizes things like heartbeat, obviously it's associated with touch. And so if people are touching or people are engaging in the sorts of behaviors that I mentioned earlier, that can increase oxytocin further, that's going to further increase the depth of the bond. But the point here is that there's actually a hormonal glue between individuals, okay, infant and mother, friends, teammates, romantic partners, and so on. And that hormonal glue is oxytocin. Now people vary in the extent to which they feel or have the capacity to feel bonded to anyone. And it is now generally understood that some of that variation might depend on variations in oxytocin receptors or what are called gene polymorphisms for oxytocin. Genes can have a number of different sequences in them, they're nucleotide sequences, we won't go into genetics right now, As and Gs and Cs and Ts in various combinations are what make up the genes. Genes are transcribed into RNA, RNA is translated into proteins that affect cells, okay? The oxytocin gene encodes for oxytocin and variants in that gene change the amount and function of oxytocin. There's a really interesting study published just this last year in a relatively new journal, the journal has a kind of a unusual name it's Heliyon, I think it's Heliyon and not hellion, but Heliyon, H-E-L-I-Y-O-N. This is a Cell Press journal, as far as I can tell, it's a very solid journal, certainly the Cell Press label is very stringent. And this paper is entitled, The Relation Between Oxytocin Receptor Gene Polymorphisms, which just means changes in genes or variations in genes, Adult Attachment and Instagram Sociability, and Exploratory Analysis. This is a really wild study, but I liked the study, It's very thorough. First author, last name, Carollo, C-A-R-O-L-L-O. And what they found was that by analyzing the genetics of different individuals who are on social media, and looking at how many people those individuals follow and how many people follow them, and what they come up with is a so-called social desirability index, they were able to correlate in a very straightforward way that people that carry certain variants in the oxytocin and oxytocin receptor genes actually seek out more online, social Instagram interactions. So some people I know, I won't name their names, only follow, you know, anywhere from zero to six accounts, other people follow thousands of accounts and they take the ratio of how many accounts people follow versus how many followers they have, arguably not a perfect measure, but a nice one in the sense that you can do this in a completely unbiased way with many, many thousands of subjects. And then they were able to get genomic analysis from a number of these subjects. And it turns out that people who have, let's say higher levels of oxytocin function or potential levels of oxytocin function, actively seek out more social interactions on social media. So this, I think represents an important first in the area of how social media and data from social media are starting to merge with biological data in terms of predicting how avidly people will seek out social interactions of an online type. And nowadays, we hear a lot about how online, we are connected but we're not really... What is it? We're communicating but we're not connected or the connections aren't real. I think we're going to need to revisit that. While I'm certainly a believer in the idea that face-to-face communication and common interactions with people standing in the same space or playing sports together, enjoying music together, enjoying meals together is vitally important, there's an entire generation, or several generations of people that are coming up who much of their social interaction has been online. And if you think about it, all of the things that we've spelled out earlier about common mental narrative, this left-brain system al Allan Schore, or autonomic bonding or synchronization of heartbeats according to common stories, all that is happening in online social interactions. When a thousand of us look at the exact same Instagram post, yes, we will have a thousand independent responses to that, but chances are many of us have a similar or same response based on the data that we talked about earlier in synchronization of heartbeats. And so we are socially bonded with other people through social media, and it's very apparent that the oxytocin system is playing some role in that. And this, if we zoom out makes perfect sense, because again, dopamine, serotonin, prolactin, oxytocin, none of these systems were placed in us or are organized within us in order to encourage specific and only specific types of social interactions. The one that we can say is absolutely critical is the child-parent interaction, right? Because children simply can't take care of themselves, they need a caretaker. I should have said caretaker, not parent. But infants, if they're not taken care of will die. But beyond that, we have evolved or come to realize many different types of social interactions, and online interactions nowadays are very, very common. I'm certainly involved in them, I'm guessing you're involved in them as well, we're involved in one right now, for example. The oxytocin system is absolutely threaded through and largely responsible for those types of social bonds as well. And incidentally, \"Oxytocin\" is the name of the fifth song on Billie Eilish's second album, \"Happier Than Ever.\" So we've covered a lot about the biology and indeed the neural circuitry and neurochemistry and neuroendocrinology of social bonding. I want to make sure that I highlight the key features that go into any and all of your social bonds. First of all, all social bonds have the potential to include both what we call emotional empathy and cognitive empathy. And so if you are interested in establishing and deepening social bonds of any kind, it's important that you put some effort towards this thing that we call emotional empathy, which is really about sharing autonomic experience. Now, depending on the relationship that will take on different contexts, what's appropriate in one type of bond is not going to be appropriate in another type of bond. Physical contact for instance, is appropriate for certain types of bonds and not for others. Nonetheless, emotional empathy and the synchronization of autonomic function, heart rate breathing, et cetera, can be best accomplished by paying attention to external events in particular narrative story music and perhaps sports or other types of experience as an external stimulus to drive synchrony of those internal states. The other aspect of forming deep bonds is cognitive empathy. Again, cognitive empathy is not about agreeing on things or viewing things the exact same way, it's about really gaining understanding of how somebody else thinks about something, really paying attention to that, and then paying attention to how you think about and feel about something. So that's what cognitive empathy is. So emotional and cognitive empathy together are what make up these really robust bonds of various kinds. Now we also talked about introversion and extroversion, and I'd like to try and dismantle the common misperceptions about introversion extroversion because when we look at the neural circuitry, as you recall, introverts are not people that don't like social interaction, it's just that they feel filled up or sated by less social interaction than would be an extrovert. And that's because at least according to the social homeostasis circuit model, they actually get more dopamine from less social interaction. Okay, it's like somebody who is sated by less amount of food. Okay, it doesn't mean they don't have the same appetite, it just means that they get more from less. Whereas extroverts get less dopamine release from an equivalent amount of social interaction. And of course these aren't precise measurements, but on the whole extroverts need more social interaction, more frequent, more long-lasting, et cetera, in order to achieve that dopamine threshold, because again, dopamine is driving that craving of social interaction. And once it's met, then people don't feel like they have to seek social interaction as much. So for those of you that feel as if you're an introvert or extrovert or that know introverts and extroverts, it's not about how verbal people are, it's not about how much they seek out social interactions per se, it's about how much social interaction is enough for the given person. Now, the whole reason for providing this framework, this biological circuitry, et cetera, is not to simply put a reductionist view on things that you already realized and knew, but rather to give you some leverage points to understand how is it that you form social bonds? How is it that you might be challenged in forming certain types of social bonds? And to think about entry points, to both establishing and reinforcing social bonds of different kinds. Hopefully it will also give you insight into why breakups, whether it be between friendships or romantic partners can be so painful. A breakup of any kind involves both a breaking of that emotional empathy and that cognitive empathy. And indeed it has a neuro-biological and hormonal underpinning, right? We go into some sense, a social isolation, even if we're surrounded by other types of people, if one of our major sources of oxytocin or one of our major sources of dopamine suddenly is not around, that is incredibly devastating to a nervous system. And to borrow from the great psychologist and neurobiologist Lisa Feldman Barrett, who says, you know, we are not just individuals, we are nervous systems influencing other nervous systems and their nervous systems are influencing us. I think that's the right way to think about it. So it should come as no surprise that breakups of various kinds are very challenging regardless of what underlied that breakup, whether or not somebody's moving or an actual decision of one person to leave the relationship or both, et cetera. On the more positive side, largely biological, but to some extent, psychological view of social bonding will also allow you to orient in this vast landscape that we call social bonds. To understand why it is perhaps that you seek out so many online interactions. Maybe you have the oxytocin polymorphism that causes you to want more, follow more accounts, or interact more with people and comment more, respond to comments, who knows? I'm also hoping that it will allow you to get a lens into how you can strengthen the social bonds that you want to strengthen, and to establish new social bonds that you want to establish. None of this has meant to manipulate or leverage social bonds that wouldn't otherwise form, to the contrary, it's about identifying what are the specific routes by which social bonds are created and allowing you, I hope, to work with people that you feel challenged in forming social bonds with, or maybe deciding to completely divorce from those social bonds entirely because there's absolutely no hope of ever forming emotional or cognitive empathy. I certainly acknowledge that that could be the case too. So there's both a light and a dark and a gray zone to this entire thing that we call social bonding. What is not graded, but is absolute, as they say, is that social bonds are vitally important to us as a species, whether or not they are at a distance over social media, whether or not they are in close proximity, actual physical contact. Today, what I've really tried to illustrate is that there are a common set of biological, neurochemical and hormonal underpinnings to what we call social bonding. And so while it is complex and it is subjective, it involves the hierarchies, it involves our previous upbringing, it involves our goals, et cetera, it is not infinitely complex, and in that sense, it is tractable. Hopefully I've offered you some leavers or some entry points under which you can both understand and move towards social bonds that would be more satisfying and more gratifying for you. That's certainly one of the goals. The other one is that hopefully if you are a clinician or simply the friend that people go to, or the family member that people go to when they are challenged through various challenges and social bonds, that you can start to perhaps pass along some of the information as a way of people understanding what they're going through as they are breaking up, but also as they are falling in love, as they are forming attachments, and as they are being challenged with attachments. That's my hope, and especially as you head into the holidays and end of year, but also as it continues into 2022, I would hope that you would take this knowledge and apply it in any of the ways that you feel are meaningful and adaptive for you.

While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them, for things like enhancing the depth and quality of sleep, for things like focus, immune system, et cetera. If you'd like to see the supplements that I take, you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman. The reason we partnered with Thorne is because thorn has the highest levels of stringency in terms of the quality of the ingredients that they include in their supplements and the precision of the amounts of the supplements that they include. This is not true for a lot of other supplement brands out there. Thorne is partnered with the Mayo Clinic, with all the major sports teams, so there's tremendous confidence in their stringency.

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we continue in our discussion about sensation or how we sense things. On previous episodes, we talked about sensing light and sound waves for things like vision and hearing. Today, we are going to talk about our sense of self or what's called interoception. Interoception is our sensing of our internal landscape, things like our heartbeat, our breathing, and our gut, how full our gut might happen to be, or how empty our gut might happen to be. But also our inner landscape with respect to chemistry, how acidic, or how good or bad we feel on the inside. This discussion about sense of self and interoception has many important, actionable items that relate to bodily health and brain health, and believe it or not, our ability to perform well or perform poorly in life. Indeed, it has profound influence on our rates of healing. So today we are going to talk about all the aspects of our inner landscape and how our brain and body communicate. And there will be many actionable protocols as we go along that discussion. Before we begin our discussion about sense of self, I want to highlight some very recently published research findings that I believe are immediately actionable and that everybody should be aware of. These are data that were published by my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg's laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine, and the data were published in the Journal Cell, which is a very high stringency cell press journal. So phenomenal data. What this study showed was that individuals given a high fiber diet actually experienced less diversity of what's called the gut microbiome. The number of positive or health promoting bacteria in the gut was actually reduced by a high fiber diet, whereas individuals that ate just a couple of servings of fermented food each day, experience important and beneficial increases in anti-inflammatory markers. And that could be traced back to improvements in the gut microbiome diversity, the diversity of bugs, literally little bacteria that live in the gut, which might sound bad, but they are actually very health promoting. I'm going to get into all the details of this study later in the episode, but I just wanted to emphasize these findings because they are immediately actionable. I think for most people ingesting one or two servings of fermented food each day is reasonable and does not bring with it tremendous costs or tremendous inconvenience. And I think many people are ingesting high fiber diets thinking that that's the best way to improve their gut microbiome. So while these data may prove to be controversial among the folks out there in the nutrition community, that really high fiber diet, I want to just emphasize that these data were looked at in a very unbiased way. They were done with large scale screens of all sorts of inflammatory markers. There was no specific hypothesis going in. It was purely exploratory, but the data are very clear. It doesn't mean you shouldn't eat fiber doesn't mean that fiber is bad, but it really shows that eating fermented foods, just one or two servings a day, and maybe even ramping up to three or four servings per day can be very beneficial for many aspects of health. Before we go any further. I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford, it is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roka. Rocha makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolutely highest quality. The company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about their sunglasses and eyeglasses is developed with performance in mind. I've spent my career working on the visual system and its various functionings within the brain and within the eye, Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses are so phenomenal because they allow the visual system to do what it does best, which is to adjust to changes in what we call luminance or brightness, with many sunglasses out there and with many eyeglasses as well, if the brightness in the room changes or you get cloud cover, or you walk into a shadow, you have to take the glasses on or off, you can't see as well. But the folks at Roka really understand how the visual system works. And so they've designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses such that you never experienced that shift. You can walk into a shadow. The amount of sunlight can change. You can go into a dark room, et cetera, provided there's enough light to see you're going to see everything crystal clear. In addition you see everything crystal clear because the lens quality is terrific and the sunglasses and eyeglasses are very lightweight. So you don't even notice that they're on your face. Also the sunglasses and eyeglasses are designed for performance. You can use them while running or while cycling. Even if you sweat, they won't slip off your face. And as I mentioned before, they're very lightweight. So everything about these glasses is terrific and they have a terrific aesthetic. They have a lot of different styles to select from. And unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there, they won't make you look like a cyborg. You could wear them to dinner or to somebody's home. And they look really nice.

Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be assessed, can only be measured from a quality blood test. And now with the advent of quality DNA tests, you can get further insight into the status of your immediate and long term health. One of the problems with a lot of blood and DNA tests that are out there, however, is you get the numbers back, you get the levels of metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera, but you don't get any information about what to do with those numbers or how to actually shift them in the direction that you want to. With Inside Tracker, they have this very easy to use dashboard and that dashboard makes it very clear, not just what your levels of hormones, et cetera are, but what actions to take in terms of nutrition or exercise or other lifestyle factors to bring those numbers into the appropriate ranges for you.

Headspace is a meditation app that's backed by 25 peer reviewed published studies and has over 600,000 five-star reviews. I started meditating when I was in my teens, but for many years I found it hard to maintain a meditation practice, I don't think I'm alone with that. I think many people start meditating. They'll do it for a few weeks or a few months, or maybe even a year. And then they'll give up the meditation practice. And we know from so many peer reviewed studies that meditation has a number of very positive effects on our brain health, our ability to focus and our bodily health. So it's a great thing, we probably should all be doing it, but most of us, including myself, have found it hard to stick to a meditation practice. Then I started using the Headspace app and what I found is I could be very consistent with my meditation practice because they have meditations that are short, meditation that are medium length, and meditations that are a bit longer, all of which benefit me. The meditations that they have also are of different styles. You can try different forms of meditation. I particularly like having a guide for my meditation. It just helps me stay focused, helps me stay on track and I'm able to derive all those regular benefits of meditation and keep the practice up on a regular basis, if you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get a one month totally free trial. And with that, you'll get all of Headspace's meditations, the full library of meditations. You just go to headspace.com/special offer, and you get all of their meditations for one free month and you get to try it, if you don't like it, you can stop. But I think you will enjoy it. I certainly enjoy meditation and we know that it's very beneficial for all of us. If you're somebody who cares about your immediate and long-term health, and if you're somebody who's interested in performance of any kind in work in relationships, et cetera, today's topic I believe is among the more important ones for you. Of all the topics I could cover, this thing that we call sense of self, which is also called interoception has perhaps the most foundational level of importance for all that. We feel all that we do and all that we are capable of doing. In fact I will go so far as to say that interoception or our ability to sense our inner real estate is right there next to sleep. And perhaps one other feature of our health and bodily function that primary early determine how good we feel in the now in the short term, and in the longterm, and sets the stage for everything we are capable of doing. And if we don't take care of this thing that we call interoception, just like if we don't take care of sleep, we cannot perform well and we will not remain healthy. Interoception and sense of self are essentially the same thing, I will use those terms interchangeably, at least for sake of today's discussion. And I promise that if you can learn a little bit about the mechanisms of self sensing, of understanding what's going on in your internal milieu, as we say your internal environment, you will position yourself to do some very simple things that can lead to outsize positive effects on everything from sleep to body composition, to mental focus, to mood, your ability to regulate stress, and indeed even your ability to heal and recovery from injuries of different kinds, brain injury and bodily injury. So sense of self is absolutely crucial. It's sometimes called our sixth sense, right alongside the other five senses like hearing vision, touch, taste, smell, et cetera, but sense of self is different. Sense of self is really about what's going on internally within the confines of our skin. And it involves two key features that if you can understand those features, and you understand what modulates or changes, our ability to sense those features, there are a lot of things that you can do in terms of how you structure your nutritional practices, how you relate to your exercise practices, perhaps even certain things that you take in terms of supplementation that can basically make you feel better, more alert, and more capable for everything. I don't think that's a hyperbolic statement, I, in fact, I know it's not a hyperbolic statement because we have a system in our body that connects our brain to all of our bodily organs and connects all of those bodily organs to our brain. And that communication between brain and body in both directions creates a situation where either we are positioned to do things well, or we are positioned to do things poorly. So I really want to dive in and dissect, what is this system of brain, body communication? What does it look like? What are the actual neurons and connections? And as I do that, I promise that I'm going to place protocols, tools that you can apply in order to make sure that those neurons and connections are working optimally. So let's begin by talking about what system communicates the brain to the body and the body back to the brain. The system that's most often associated with this is our 10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve. The word vagus relates to the word vagabond, which to wander, and indeed the vagus nerve is a vast, enormous wandering set of nerves, so it's not one nerve. It's not like one fiber, one axon. As we say in the nervous system, we have these wires, we call axons that let neurons communicate. It's a bunch of neurons and a bunch of wires that go everywhere, so where do they go? Well they leave the brain, and the brain stem, the brain stem is kind of the back of your brain. If you touch the back of your neck, it's about three inches deep to where you're touching. The neurons that are there send information into the body to control your bodily organs, how fast your heart is, beating how fast you're breathing, how fast your digestion is occurring. Even things like whether or not you are going to secrete so-called killer cells, your immune cells from your spleen to go ward off bacteria. Now the neurons there don't know what to do unless they receive information about what's going on within the body and within the body, your heart, your lungs, your diaphragm, your gut, so everything from your intestines to your stomach, et cetera, and your spleen or sending information also up to the brain. So as I mentioned before, it's a two-way street. So the vagus nerve is a very important nerve, but just by saying vagus nerve, it sounds like a singular. It sounds like one thing, but actually what we're talking about is a series of super highways, it's like Google maps, it's got stuff going everywhere with alternate routes, communicating back and forth. There are two fundamental features of what's going on in your body that need to be communicated to your brain, these neurons in your brain stem in order for your brain and your body to work together correctly. And the two types of information are mechanical information. So things like pressure, things like lack of pressure and chemical information, whether or not your gut is acidic or whether or not it's not acidic, whether or not you have some sort of pathogen, you know, something that you ate or that got into your body somehow and is making you sick or whether or not you don't have a pathogen in your body. So you've got mechanical sensing and chemical sensing. So when you think about your sense of self and your ability to understand what's going on in your body, if you feel good, or if you feel bad, your sense of self is dependent on these mechanical phenomenon and these chemical phenomenon. And for every organ in your body, whether or not that's your heart or your lungs or your spleen, both the mechanical information about that organ for instance, is if your gut is full or empty, whether or not your heart is beating fast or beating slowly, that's mechanical, and chemical information, whether or not your gut feels nice, and whether, you know, when I say nice, I mean, whether or not it has a balance of acidity and alkalinity, that feels right to you or whether or not your gut feels off, it doesn't feel quite right. That's chemical information. If you are not getting enough oxygen and levels of carbon dioxide and other gas go up too high. So your lungs can register that and that chemical information is sent to your brain. And then your brain does certain things actually really encourages you to do certain things in order to adjust that chemistry. So the first principle that everyone should understand about their sense of self is that they are sensing mechanical and chemical information about every organ in their body, except for one, and that's the brain. Your brain actually doesn't have pain receptors. It doesn't even have touch receptors. The brain is a command center. It helps drive and govern changes in the organs of the body. But your brain doesn't move, at least not much. It can move a little bit fluid moves within it. But as long as you're healthy, it's not moving that much. Your brain has no sensation of its own, in fact, when they do brain surgery on people, they will the size or put some anesthesia on the scalp. They'll cut away the skin there so that people don't feel anything. They'll use some anesthesia they'll peel back the skin and then they'll use a, let's call it what it is, it's a bone saw. And they basically saw open a little window in the skull. I've actually done this before and seen this before. I've done this many times before, and once you're inside the brain, you can put electrodes in there and you can put various things in there, of course, all for therapeutic purposes. And you do that without any anesthesia to the actual brain tissue, because it has no receptors to sense anything. It doesn't have pain receptors. It doesn't have pressure receptors. None of that, when you have a headache in your head, feels like it's too much pressure, well that's because of here's that lie outside the brain. So your organs are different. They need to tell your brain what's going on. And there are ways that you can control the mechanical and the chemical state of your organs in ways that are very powerful, and this is crucial to do, because if you can properly regulate the mechanical and chemical environment of your body, your brain functions better. This is absolutely clear from data that if your gut is healthy, if you get the alkalinity right, the acidity, right, and if your spleen is healthy and happy, and if your lungs are working properly, not just breathing and pumping in and out air, but you're breathing at the right cadence for a particular activity, then your brain will function better. So let's talk about how you can adjust the mechanical and chemical environment of your organs in order to make your brain better and how your brain can make the mechanical and chemical environment within your organs function better. For instance we're going to talk about how you can change the chemistry of your gut in order for your brain to be able to focus better, think better, remember better and sleep better. And we're going to talk about how you can change the chemistry of other organs in your body, such that your immune system will function better than it would otherwise. And you can actually heal faster from small cuts and bruises, but also injuries of any kind, even major injuries. So as I mentioned before, we've got these organs, the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm, and I'll explain what that is, the gut and the spleen. And the spleen is this immune organ. Let's take one example of these and explain how mechanical and chemical information from this particular set of organs communicates to the brain and how that changes how our brain works. And the organ I'd like to focus on first are the lungs and the diaphragm. So we're all familiar with our lungs, these two big bags of air, but they're actually not two big bags of air. They actually have little tiny sacs within them, actually millions of little sacs called the alveoli of the lungs. The alveoli of the lungs are like little tiny balloons throughout our lungs, and the more of those balloons, we have, the more air that we can actually contain. So we are not too big bags of air in there, our lungs, we actually have millions and millions of little tiny bags of air within those lungs. Those little bags of air can fill up or they can deflate, right, just like your lungs overall can fill up or they can deflate. The diaphragm is a muscle, it's kind of shaped like a dome. So it's kind of a, you know, think about a basketball or a soccer ball that has most of the air pushed out of it. And so it's kind of crescent shape or dome shaped, and it sits below our lungs and the way the diaphragm and the lungs work together is very interesting. The diaphragm is actually skeletal muscles. So it's just like a bicep or a quadricep. And the fact that it is skeletal muscle is important because it has a unique property, which is that you can control it voluntarily. You can decide to take control of your diaphragm by just consciously deciding you want to breathe in a particular way, just like you can take conscious control over your legs. They will work just fine, if you're not thinking about them, as you walk as provide, you already know how to walk, but at any moment, you can decide to change the rate of your walking, your so-called cadence of walking. So the diaphragm as a skeletal muscle also has that property, the diaphragm moves up and down, depending on how you breathe, or rather, I should say how the diaphragm moves up and down determines how you breathe. How you breathe is also dependent on little muscles that are between your ribs, the intercostals and other muscles, if you're a martial arts fan that Bruce Lee was famous for having these very pronounced intercostals from doing all sorts of, you know, bridging exercise, et cetera. But those are the muscles. And we all have them, even if some of us, most of us don't have, intercostals like Bruce Lee. So when you breathe a couple things happen, but let's talk about the mechanical things first. And then let's talk about how those mechanical steps relate back to the brain and what that does for the brain. And I can promise you that if you develop an awareness of these mechanical changes, you do not have to go through extensive breathwork practice or do extensive breathwork. You will immediately believe it or not develop a sense of your breathing self of your lungs and diaphragm. It takes no practice, but once you do it, you will forever be changed in terms of your awareness of your breathing and your ability to leverage your breathing. Kind of like the steering wheel on a car in order to shift your brain in the direction that you want to go. So it's a very powerful system. And the way it works is the following. And this will also incorporate the heart, so, and by the heart, I don't mean it in the emotional sense. Although we don't rule out emotions here at the Huberman Lab podcast, we like emotions, but I'm talking about the heart as an organ, as a beating organ, that circulates blood. So when we inhale, these little sacs in our lungs fill up and our lungs expand. And when we do that, we take up space in our thoracic cavity and our diaphragm moves down, okay. When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up, the lungs get smaller, okay? So inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. This actually controls our heart rate, but it does it by changing the way that our brain works. And it works in the following way. So when we inhale, our lungs fill our diaphragm moves down. Our heart actually has a little more space because the diaphragm's moved down. So the heart gets a little bit bigger, physically bigger, not in the emotional sense, but physically bigger. And as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart flows at a slower rate because it's a larger volume, so bigger volume heart, same amount of blood inside the heart means slower flow. Okay, sort of like expanding a pipe. The brain registers that because there are a set of neurons in the heart called the sinoatrial node. It sends that information to the brain. That information is registered by the brain and the brain sends a message back to the heart to speed the heart up. So every time you inhale because of these mechanical changes in the diaphragm and lungs, and because of the mechanical changes in the heart, your brain sends a signal to the heart to speed the heart up, so if you do long inhales or you inhale more vigorously, you actually are speeding your heart up. Now, of course you have to exhale as well. But for instance, if I were to inhale very long like [inhales heavily] the entire time my heart rate is increasing. And then if I did a quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, but if I kept doing that, [inhales heavily, exhales quickly] my heart rate would increase. It's not going to increase linearly and forever, but it will increase with each inhale. Or I can simply make my inhales more vigorous. [inhales quickly] And my heart rate will speed up. This is an autonomic and automatic relationship between the diaphragm, the lungs, the brain, and the heart. Now, if inhale speed the heart up, what happens on exhales? When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up. It's a little counterintuitive, but you can kind of think about it as like pushing the plunge on a syringe, right? When you exhale, this thing moves up and as the diaphragm moves up, the heart has less space. Meaning it gets a little bit smaller, which means that whatever volume of blood is inside the heart moves faster, through that smaller volume, that information is sent to the brain via these collection of neurons called the sinoatrial node for you aficionados. The brain then sends information via the vagus nerve back to the heart, to slow the heart down. So while inhales speed up the heart, that's the net effect exhales, slow the heart down. And the reason they slow the heart down is because of a register in the change in mechanical pressure between the diaphragm, the lungs and the heart. So this is to me, the simplest and most straightforward example of how the brain is changing the way our organs work, our heart in this case, according to changes in mechanical interoception. Now, we're not always aware of this, some of us are aware of it, some of us aren't. If you do it right now, you will be aware of it, so you can try this. You can basically, this is an experiment or an example in interoception, in sensing one's self. So if you inhale, doesn't matter how long you inhale. I'll do it for a couple seconds [inhales quickly] and then exhale twice as long. [exhales slowly] Nose or mouth, doesn't matter, the entire time that you're exhaling, you're slowing your heart down. So just as a car has an accelerator and a brake, or you can slow a car by coming off the accelerator. When you exhale, you're effectively coming off the accelerator, or if you want to think about it differently, you're hitting the brake, you're slowing down your heart rate. Now, normally your heart rate stays in more or less the same range for a given activity because you're inhaling and exhaling. But this is just a simple way of showing that mechanical changes in your viscera can change the way that your brain works and then your brain changes the way that those viscera work. And it's a very concrete agreement, it's like a contract between the organs of your body and the brain. In fact, you can think about this contract in more detail, and you can leverage this in a very powerful way to set the conditions of your mind. If you want to be more calm, emphasize exhales, and the simplest way to do this. I've talked about this many times before, but if you haven't heard me say it, this will become immediately clear is to emphasize exhales through what's called a physiological sigh. Two inhales, could be through the nose of the mouth, but ideally through the nose, so [inhales quickly twice] so followed by a long exhale. [exhales slowly] Those double inhales are kind of important because what they do is they maximally fill all those little sacs in your lungs, and then when you breathe out, you're exhaling as much of the so-called carbon dioxide in your system as possible. We'll talk about carbon oxide in a second. So the fastest way to calm down is to emphasize exhales. When you make exhales longer, you're slowing your heart rate, you're calming down. You don't need any sophisticated training. You don't have to do this for minutes on end. You don't have to do anything. You don't even have to call it breathwork. It's just respiration, and in fact, you do this every night. When you go to sleep and carbon dioxide builds up too much in your bloodstream, or if you hold your breath or something, or you watch an animal or a small child that sleeping, they will occasionally do these double inhale long exhales it's way of slowing the heart down and eliminating carbon oxide. The opposite is also true. If you inhale deeply or vigorously and then exhale less long or less vigorously, you will increase your level of alertness through these purely mechanical aspects of your interoception. So for instance, if I were to take a big deep inhale [inhales deeply] and then a short exhale, [exhales quickly] and then another one, a big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale, [exhales quickly] It only takes two or three of those before you start to feel more alert. And that's because your heart rate is increasing. And actually if you keep doing that for 25 or 30 breaths of inhale deep short exhale, you will start to secrete a lot of adrenaline. This hormone that comes from your kidneys and from your brainstem make you feel really alert. You will actually feel as if you've had a cup of espresso. So you will immediately wake up. And there's an intermediate form of breathing, which is sometimes called box breathing, but it's really equal inhale and exhale duration. And these, it basically goes like this. You're you're going to inhale, so do this for maybe two, three seconds inhale, [inhales] then hold, okay, two, three seconds. Then exhale, two, three seconds. Then hold two, three seconds. Most often people forget to hold. So it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal or more or less equal durations, could be one second, could be two seconds, could be three seconds. Most people find that when you get out past five seconds, they start to struggle to maintain the so-called box breathing. And most people can't consciously box breathe for too terribly long without having to think about it. But the point here is that through purely mechanical means changing the way that you breathe, emphasizing inhales or exhales, or keeping them the same will change the way that your brain works, how alert you are and how well you function in anything. And again, this doesn't mean that breathwork has no value. It's just simply to say that long extended protocols of breathwork are simply, they are truly simply just an exploration of this fundamental relationship between the mechanics of your internal organs and your brain and how your brain controls those internal organs. Now you might ask, well, how is this pressure known? How does the body actually know how full the lungs are, now? This is an answer that's more for the aficionados out there, but I've had a few requests, or I should say thousands of requests for more in-depth science, so if you're not interested more in depth science, just this will allow you to tune out now for maybe just 10 seconds, and if you are interested, pay careful attention, there is a set of receptors which are called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo means pressure. And these were discovered a few years ago by a couple of different laboratories, but one of the main ones, one of the main laboratories that discovered these piezo receptors is the laboratory of Ardem Patapoutian. I love saying his name, even though I'm probably pronouncing it, he's a friend and a former colleague when my lab was down in San Diego, he's at the Scripps Institute, he's a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, which basically means that he's a total stud of science and has made many important discoveries. The piezo receptors line many tissues, and inform the brain about pressure in those tissues. But the lungs have a particular category of piezo receptors called piezo two receptors. And as you fill your lungs and these little sacs of air, the alveoli fill, the piezo two receptors because of the way they react to that filling send information by way of a bunch of neurons, a bunch of wires up to the brain and tell you how full your lungs are, so that's the kind of mechanistic detail. If you want to learn more about that, you can look up our Ardem's lab at the Scripps and the beautiful work that they and other laboratories are doing on piezos, piezos are pretty cool. I think I also just like saying piezo, so that's why I brought that up as well. So mechanical sensing of the lungs, heart and diaphragm. And now let's talk about chemical sensing because there's carbon dioxide and there's oxygen. And this is really simple. You have oxygen and carbon dioxide and you need them both. I sometimes hear people talk about carbon dioxide is this bad thing and oxygen, it has a good thing. You need them both, and you need them in the appropriate balance. You have a collection of neurons in your brain that register when carbon dioxide levels get to a certain point in your bloodstream. When that point, that threshold is reached, these neurons fire, and they cause you to breathe sometimes called the gasp reflex, it just makes you want to inhale. And as a consequence, you bring in more oxygen. Okay, so we don't really breathe to get oxygen. That's a by-product of inhaling to eliminate carbon dioxide. You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go too high. In fact, if you want to freak somebody out and we do these in experiments, and I don't recommend you do this, you just increase the levels of carbon dioxide that they inhale, and the brain will go into an almost immediate panic response because the health of all our tissues depends on keeping a nice balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen. You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go too high. So the impulse to breathe, if you're under water, or if you hold your breath is triggered by these neurons and the triggering of those neurons comes from elevated carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. And for those of you that don't quite know how to conceptualize the relationship between bloodstream and breath, I do think it's important. And maybe you remember this from high school biology, but if you don't, I'll make it clear for you now, it's very easy. You inhale air and that air and the oxygen molecules in that air actually move from your lungs into the bloodstream because these little alveoli of the lungs, those little sacs of air are in there, they basically have a lot of little micro vessels and capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although they're mostly capillaries, micro capillaries are the little tiny ones, that line them, so there's actually an interface and opportunity for air and molecules within the air to pass into the blood and then they move in your bloodstream, and when you exhale, the opposite is true. So you can move things from the air, into your bloodstream or from your bloodstream into the air by way of the lungs, and there's a lot more detail to it. And I'm sure those of you that are experts out there. If you want to put some stuff in the comments, maybe a little bit of a kind of intermediate tutorial, you might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. If you know a lot about this, just I'll check it, but make sure you get the details, right. Make sure you know the process. And I find that for people that are interested in understanding how breathing really works, it's really nice to think about the relationship between the heart and the vascular system, the blood and the air system, the respiration system, and breathing, because those two things are very, we say, they're interdigitated, they're interwoven with one another. So how does this work, well, carbon dioxide is too high, you breathe in, you inspire, you, inhale you off as a consequence, when you exhale, you offload carbon dioxide. There's a really cool way that you can explore this chemistry of your breathing and your bloodstream and the way that your brain works in ways that can really benefit your health. And it works the following way. You want to essentially sit or lie down. It doesn't really matter. You definitely don't want to be anywhere near water, not a bathtub, not a hot tub, not a, you know, not a cold dunk or something. In fact, don't even be in a puddle. And what you want to do in this case is you're going to breathe in deep. So that's going to increase your heart rate and then exhale passively by just letting air fall out of your mouth. So it will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively] So it's you breathe in vigorously and then you let the air just fall out of your mouth. When you do that, what you're essentially doing is you're bringing in a lot of oxygen through that deep breath. And you're exhaling a little bit of that carbon dioxide. But if you were to repeat it 25 times, maybe 30 times, it doesn't matter if it's 25 or 30, somewhere in there, you would essentially start bringing in a lot of oxygen and blowing off or exhaling a lot of carbon dioxide. So you're actually going to change the chemistry of your internal landscape, and you can then sense it. You can interocept what that is like. And there are some really interesting reasons for wanting to do that, so I'm not going to do all 25 or 30 now, maybe do five or 10, so you can get a sense of what it looks like, so that it's clear. I'm going to essentially demonstrate now, so it's inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale through the mouth,[exhales] I am inhaling the nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales passively multiple times] So it's essentially, excuse me, a two second or so inhale and then a one second or so exhale, and as I was doing that, I can kind of feel my face get flush and my body is heating up and my brain is heating up, what's happening there? Well that pattern of breathing is increasing levels of adrenaline in my brain and body, and I'm getting more alert. Then after 25 or 30 of those, you exhale all your air. [exhales deeply] You dump all your air. You can do that, your nose or your mouth. And then you hold your breath with your lungs empty for about 15 to 30 seconds. Now, for those of you that want to explore this, and please be careful as you explore this, don't do anything stupid, like do this while you're driving or something like that. You can exhale all your air and what you'll find then is you can hold your breath for a very long time. And the reason you can do that is because you've blown off all the carbon dioxide or most of the carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. So you shifted the chemistry of your blood by breathing in a particular way. And by doing that, you are no longer triggering these neurons that cause the gasp reflex or the reflex to breathe. Now, of course you have to breathe sooner or later but what you'll find is if normally your ability to hold your breath is a minute or so before you really feel that gasp reflex kick in, you might find that you can go 90 seconds or two minutes. And with some practice, people find that they can start holding their breath for three or four minutes or longer. This is actually how free divers do what they do. I do not want anyone free diving. If you're going to learn free diving, please learn it from an expert. Many people die trying to teach themselves out of free dive or trying to teach their friends at a free dive when they don't know what they're doing. This is not what this is about, don't again, don't do this anywhere near water, but it is a very interesting exploration of how you can shift the chemistry of your bloodstream by modulating your air by modulating the mechanics of your diaphragm and lungs and thereby shift the way your mind works, your brain. And in fact, what you'll notice is that even though during that 25 or 30 breaths, [inhales and exhales quickly] you'll feel very alert, when you exhale all your air and you're in the breath hold, you will feel very alert, but very calm. Now this is interesting because it's a state that we all sort of want to achieve alert, but calm, but have a hard time achieving. And so for those of you that have a hard time obtaining focus for sake of work or focus for sake of anything I should say, and when you are able to achieve focus, it's through the use of things like stimulants, or you feel like you have to have a cold shower or ice bath, or you have to have four espresso in order to be alert, but then you're too alert, you're jittery. You can't focus. This pattern of breathing can lend itself very well to entering states of alert, but calm for the fall, the 10 or even 20 minutes that follow that breathing. And then you could repeat it if you want. So it's a very useful practice to explore. Some of you may be familiar with this practice and so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof is a practitioner of what's called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing has been around for centuries. And for those of you that are familiar with breathwork and yoga practices, I acknowledged that nothing I just described is new based on science, however, the science informs why those practices work. And just as a little mini editorial, I just want to emphasize as well. That one thing that this podcast is really about is trying to remove fancy nomenclature, whether or not it's yogic nomenclature or scientific nomenclature so that people can access protocols. Because the moment we start naming things after people or calling them Tumo et cetera, I have no problem with that, but it doesn't inform how the practices are done, nor does it inform the underlying mechanisms. So here I'm trying to teach you the mechanisms. And as a final point to that, the most powerful form of breathing is the one that takes into account the fundamental mechanisms that in increase heart rate, that exhales decrease heart rate, and that carbon dioxide and oxygen relate to the bloodstream and the brain in particular ways, once you understand those components, then you can create your own so-called breathwork practices. You can breathe in the ways that best serve you, as opposed to thinking that one protocol is the best or holy protocol for everything, because it's simply not. As a final final point, I want to say that as you shift the way that you breathe, whether or not you're showing off more carbon dioxide or bringing in more oxygen, you are fundamentally changing the chemistry of your internal milieu have your body, and that has been shown to have important effects on the way that your immune system functions and the way that you deal with inflammation and all sorts of different sort of things that can enter your body and cause problems or conditions of stress, et cetera. So I will explore that further as the episode goes on, but I want to move on to just touch on one other aspect of reading, that's purely mechanical, which I think is very interesting and important, which relates to a particular reflex that you're going to be very familiar with in a second. And that can serve you very well in times of extreme stress. The reflex I'm referring to is something called the Hering Breuer Reflex. I'm not going to go into details about how the Hering Breuer reflex works, but it has to do with particular classes of neurons and cells that are called a Baroreceptors. Those are basically pressure receptors, they sense pressure. And basically what the Hering Breuer reflex is about is that when your lung is inflated, your desire to breathe is reduced. So you can try that right now, you can inhale [inhales] huge big thing of air. And hold, okay? Your desire to breathe will kick in later than were are you to exhale all your air and hold your breath. When you exhale all your air and your breath, unless you've done the sort of protocol I described a few minutes ago of doing a bunch of inhales and exhales first in a very deliberate way, you will feel empty. Those Baroreceptors are going to be firing like crazy saying, there's no pressure in here, there's no pressure here, I got nothing in here. You need to breathe, you need to breathe in, the gasp reflex will kick in sooner. You can apply that in all sorts of situations related to exercise, related to modulating stress, et cetera. So the Hering Breuer reflex is a very powerful one. This is why you take a big deep breath before you go under water. [inhales heavily] All right, you're not going to exhale all your air and go under water. If you were to exhale all your air and go under water, you would absolutely feel the need to come up sooner for a breath of air than had you a full tank, so to speak a full of lungs full of air. And this is also the way that people teach themselves to feel comfortable under water. So when you learn how to swim, you learn how to swim both by having air in your lungs while you're underwater and no air in your lungs while you're underwater. In any event the Hering Breuer reflex is yet another dimension to the way that mechanical pressure influences your brain's decision-making, about what to do with your body, in this case, whether or not to breathe. So now I want to shift away from breathing and diaphragm and lungs and move toward another organ within our viscera, which is our gut. So this includes our stomach and our intestines, our esophagus and so forth. It's been said before, both by me and by others that we are, but a series of tubes, and indeed that's true. Believe it or not, every system in your body is a tube. Your brain is actually a tube that connects your spinal cord, which has also a tube. You started off as a tube, you were like a churro. You know, those churros I don't know if you're not familiar with churros, they're like donuts that are shaped like a tube. That's essentially what you look like early in development, not long after conception and the front end of that churro grew and grew and grew, but you always maintained a hollow through that tube. That's why you have what are called ventricles, gaps or a space in your brain and spinal cord that run the length of your brain and spinal cord and fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, and other things move through that space. We're going to return to the ventricles later, they are very important. They're just space filled with fluid, but they do a lot. Similarly your digestive system starts with the tube at your mouth and of course goes down through your throat. And then you've got all the elements of the stomach and the intestines, and then it comes out the other end. So you are, but a series of different tubes, your vascular system, a series of other tubes. So you're tubes. The way your digestive system works is to communicate to your brain about the status of the mechanical pressures along this tube, so within your stomach and your intestines, et cetera, and the chemical status of that tube at various portions within that tube to inform your brain about how your brain should control that tube. So let's start with the mechanical sensing of your gut. If you drink a lot of fluid, or if you eat a lot of food, your gut will fill up, your stomach will fill up with food. Now it gets digested there. It gets digested elsewhere along your digestive track too, of course but it starts getting digested there because along this tube, you have a series of what are called sphincters, which basically are like little draw pulls. Have you ever had a laundry bag, which has a drawstring on it? You pull it and then it cinches shut, and then you can open it again, that's what those are. Those are sphincter openings and you have them in your throat, you have them along your digestive tract, all the way to the end. Food will enter your gut. And if there's a lot of that food, pressure receptors, some of which are these piezo receptors will communicate to the areas of your brain that are involved in feeding, and we'll say, don't eat anymore. You don't need to consume anymore, now, some people bypass that these, I guess they have these like hotdog eating competitions. I'm always struck by how some of those people are like, seem to be rail thin, but they actually train for those competitions by ingesting large volumes of water, actually a very dangerous practice. You can actually kill yourself by drinking too much water, and you can kill yourself by ingesting too much of anything, really to expand your gut, not a good practice, not a big fan of those competitions. But even if you're one of those people or you're the world heavyweight champion of them, they are informative toward what I'm talking about now, which is that as you expand the gut, a signal is sent by neurons, literally nerve cells that are in the gut to the brain, stem up to the areas of the brain that are involved in feeding, I did a whole episode on feeding. You can find on \"Feeding, Metabolism And Hunger.\" You're welcome to listen to that episode, if you like, and we'll shut down the neurons that drive the desire to put more stuff in your mouth. That thing that people say sometimes on well in this country frequently after Thanksgiving meal, I can't put another bite in my mouth. Literally they shut down some of the basic movements of the musculature to take another fork bite. I know it sounds crazy, but they can actually control your brain. So your gut is so full that it's controlling your brains, such that this action of spooning food towards your mouth is actually inhibited. It's made more difficult or less likely to occur. It's incredible. The converse is also true, when these piezo receptors signal to the brain, that the gut is empty independent of your need, your actual need for food. There's a signal that sent to your brain that says gut is empty and neurons get stimulated in areas like the arcuate nucleus and these areas of the hypothalamus and et cetera, that drive the desire to make this action, to open the mouth and to put stuff in it in particular food. So when you find yourself at the refrigerator or you find yourself almost, you know, manically trying to get food of different cons, you're not even thinking about what you're eating, because you're so hungry, in part that's because the lack of food in your gut has sent that information to your brain and is driving particular fixed action patterns that are associated with eating, in fact, one of the first things children learn how to do is open their mouth when something is presented to it. And then they learn how to move a spoon or a fork. They're not very good at it, at first, they get all over the place, but eventually they get good at, or at least most people get good at if you watch how people eat, you know, it's kind of very variable out there. In any event, this is a purely mechanical phenomenon. And this purely mechanical phenomenon is driving our brain to drive certain behavior. You can get better at registering sense of fullness or lack of fullness in a very particular way. Some people have a very keen sense of how full or empty their stomach is, so if you've eaten anything, even if it's a small volume of food in the last hour to three hours, it's actually a worthwhile practice to take a few moments, maybe 10, 20 seconds, and actually just try and concentrate on sensing the neurons in your gut and how full you are, like for instance, I ate a few hours ago and then I had a little snack about 30 minutes ago or so. And my gut feels neither terribly full nor terribly empty. It's kind of, I would put it kind of like 30, 40% okay. So by just taking conscious awareness of how full or empty our gut is at various times between meals, after a meal, before a meal, you can very quickly develop a sense of how full or empty you are. Now, what's the consequence of that? The consequence of that is actually rather interesting. It's been shown that the consequence of that is actually that you can better override the signals of these piezo receptors and gut fullness or emptiness. So for those of you that find that you eat kind of compulsively or non-consciously, or subconsciously, I should say, probably have to be conscious enough to be awake to eat, but subconsciously you just find yourself eating and here I'm describing myself, I'm like, I'm a drive by blueberry eater. If there's a bowl of blueberries, every time I walk past it, I sort of have to grab a handful of them and pop them in my mouth, but if you develop this sense of how much mecho-pressure, it's not really word, but how much mechano-sensation is in your gut, very quickly, you can learn to override that. You might ask, why would I want to be able to override whether or not my stomach is empty or my stomach is full? Well, there are many reasons to want to do that. Many people right now are interested in so-called intermittent fasting. They're doing fast of anywhere from 12 to 16 hours, every 24 hour cycle, that's actually what my practice is. I do that on a regular basis, sometimes the, I eat breakfast, but normally I pushed breakfast out to about 11 or noon, or sometimes a little later, some people are doing longer fast, and there are really wonderful data publishing excellent journals from my colleagues Satchin Panda at the Salk Institute Of Biological Studies. And of course from other laboratories showing that intermittent fasting can and will have some positive health effects on things like liver health and brain health and other aspects of health. Whether or not it's the best form of dieting for the sake of losing weight, that's very controversial, but it's clear that having a period of fasting every 24 hours or perhaps even longer from time to time can be beneficial because it stimulates what's called autophagy, the clearing away, or the body's ability to eat certain dead cells, so called senescent cells, and for many people, they struggle with fasting because they feel they have a very keen sense of their stomach being empty. And they feel as if they have to eat. And in a kind of counter-intuitive way, there's some data that indicate that being able to sense whether or not your gut is full or empty, and just the knowledge that that's communicating information to your brain about whether to not to eat or not just that awareness, that understanding allows them to override the signal. They think, oh, you know, I'm not actually in need of nutrients right now. It's just that my stomach is empty. And these piezo receptors, and some other ones that I'll tell you about in a moment are signaling to my brain that it's empty. I don't actually need food, it's just, it's just that my brain is reacting to the fact that my gut is deflated, so to speak or a smaller, doesn't have food in it. So there are other ways that our guts communicate with our brain, it's not just our stomach talking to our brain. It's also our intestines talk to our brain. The Liberles Lab the guy's name is Steven Liberles, he runs a lab at Harvard Medical School, it's a terrific lab, does excellent work on gut, brain communication and other aspects of viscera brain communication. They discovered a category of neurons called the GLP1R neurons, these are neurons that are basically in your neck, I mean, they're part of the nervous system, but they're, you can, they can be found near your neck. And those neurons send little wires down into the intestines and deep into the stomach, but mostly into the intestines and they sense stretch of your intestines. So this is pretty wild. These neurons sense how stretched out your intestines are and how fast things are moving through your intestines, slow or fast, or if there's nothing there. And then those neurons send another branch, they have a branch in one direction, senses what's going on in your intestines. And they have another branch that goes up from your neck in your brain to either trigger the desire to eat more or just stop eating. So these are really cool neurons and they're basically stretch receptors. They look a lot like the piezo receptors that we talked about before, so these GLP1R neurons are sensing stretch, so purely mechanical sensing. And in addition to that, the Liberles Lab discovered neurons that detect nutrients themselves. Now, the main reason why we need to eat is to bring nutrients into our body. And there is another set of neurons, those are called GPR65 neurons, if you want to know, but you don't have to remember that, do the same thing in terms of their connections. They send connections down into the intestines and into the gut, into the stomach, but mostly into the intestines. And then send that information back up to the brain as to whether or not there are certain kinds of nutrients in our digestive track. Now, these neurons are the ones to pay attention to if we're talking about chemical signaling and then in the next couple of minutes, I'm going to tell you about how you can understand hunger and had a modulate your hunger for the right foods, in fact, for healthy foods. The way this is done is by leveraging the activity of these GPR65 neurons, these neurons that sense nutrients, okay. They're telling your brain what's in your gut and intestines, and you have another set of neurons that were discovered by another guy he's out at Duke University, his name is Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges he's a wonderful scientist. He has a degree in nutrition, but also in neuroscience. And he found that there are neurons that line the gut, and those neurons in collaboration with these GPR65 neurons are sensing for three things, okay? So we say nutrients, which nutrients are they looking for? What are these neurons paying attention to? While these neurons are activated by the presence of fatty acids in particular, omega-3 fatty acids, sorts of things that come from fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds of animal protein, animal, and plant substances. You can look up what has a lot of omega-3s and those omega-3s make these neurons fire electrically like crazy up to the brain and make you want to eat more of those things, but it turns out in pretty appropriate levels. These neurons also respond to amino acids. So when you eat a food, it's broken down in the gut, actually the way it's broken down in the gut is kind of interesting. Your gut basically cinches off a sphincter up top, cinches off a sphincter below it when there's food there. And then you have a series of smooth muscles that tumble the food and literally physically break it down. And then of course, enzymes come in and start digesting the food. And we're going to talk about digestion and how that's communicated to the brain in a moment. And for those of you with any autoimmune issues or digestive issues, this is going to be very important conversation. But meanwhile there are these neurons in the gut and as these fatty acids float out of the digested food, so literally fat molecules, and as amino acids are coming from the proteins as they're digested in the gut. And as a third food item, sugars are coming from the foods that we eat. These neurons will fire a lot to the brain that says, Hey, whatever you're doing up there, do more of it, okay? Now the sugars are a little bit cryptic because when I say sugars or I say amino acids, or I say fatty acids, this has nothing to do with taste. In fact, beautiful experiments have been done by the Borges Lab and by other labs showing that even if you numb the mouth, even if you gavavge, which is a really, just a, it's a fancy word for basically tube feeding, you put a tube down into the gut, you just deliver the food to the gut. So you get no opportunity to taste, it sounds pretty awful. If you force feed by gavage, or you numb the mouth, these neurons don't care about the mouth. They only care about the nutrients coming from these foods. And then they signal to the brain, hey, do that thing, do that thing where you lift that object, we call a fork or a spoon, do that thing where you drink the milkshake, do that thing where you move your mouth like this, not talking, but do that thing where you swallow. So that's how the nutrients in our gut control us. And this is why for people that experience extreme sugar cravings, or even mild sugar cravings, replacing those foods with foods that have high levels of omega-3 or amino acids can produce sugar cravings. And I've talked about this on a previous episode, but if you didn't catch it, no big deal. I'll tell you right now that for many people, the solution to sugar cravings is to ingest a small amount, maybe a teaspoon or so of an amino acid called glutamine. And if you have really extreme sugar cravings, you can even mix that glutamine with a full-fat cream, which actually makes it taste pretty darn good. And you drink that anytime you have a sugar craving or just a sip or two of that. And we find is that the sugar cravings disappear, because you're basically giving fat and amino acids to those neurons in the gut and in the intestine, that signal to the brain that you want more. Now, this doesn't give you a kind of runaway hunger for full fat cream. Although it will say when I was in high school for various reasons, but mostly because I liked the way it tastes. I was using half and half in my cereal. And I was waking up in the middle of night and drinking half and half, and that stuff tastes pretty darn good once you get used to the high fat content. Not something I do now. But the point is these neurons don't really know taste, they only know nutrients. And so you can work with that system if you crave sugar, and I do believe that most if not all of us should be trying to limit, if not eliminate simple sugars, as much as possible most of the time, then things like glutamine, things like high omega-3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want to supplement with fish oil or something similar to get omega-3s, there are other reasons for wanting to do that too, can be very beneficial. And here's what we're talking about is interoception, it's your ability to sense your inner real estate, but in this case, by way of chemical signaling, not by way of mechanical signaling. So now I'd like to talk about another aspect of gut chemistry that has profound effects on the brain, as well as on the immune system. And for those of you with auto-immune conditions, or for those of you that know people with auto-immune conditions, this is going to be a very important discussion. Your gut needs to maintain a certain level of acidity or alkalinity, for those of you without any chemistry background, basically the low numbers on the pH scale, that means more acidic, the higher, the numbers, more alkaline, so more alkaline means more basic and acidic means acidic. And it has to do with whom hydrogen atoms and all this other stuff, but you don't need to worry about that right now. We're not going to pH your gut right now, but we are going to talk about the pH of your gut. Your gut needs to be more acidic than essentially all other tissues of your body in order to function properly, bacteria thrive in alkaline conditions. I think this is important for people to understand. People are always thinking, oh, you should be more alkaline being acidic, that almost sounds like being inflamed at well, you know, it's a complicated discussion, but I think the semantics can be confusing, sometimes you want your gut to be acidic. You may ask, well, why are people taking antacids? Well, those antacids are there for a particular purpose to essentially combat acid reflux, which is the sending up of stuff in the gut towards the esophagus. And it can cause heartburn and things of that sort. And the way the antacids work is they essentially cause the sphincters above the gut to sinch shut, but they really are only dealing with a symptom, not the cause. So rewind, and about 10, 20 years ago, the discussion about gut acidity was quite a bit different than it is now in the scientific and medical literature. In fact, for many years long before, I'm going to say it here, people have been saying that it's important to maintain proper acidity of the gut, but the science and medical professions sort of looked at that as kind of a scance like, you know, what's going on there, I don't, I don't know that there's any evidence that that's actually true, there are communities of people that were prescribing, or I should say recommending that people take hydrochloric acid HCL and adjusting gut acidity that way. And it was kind of frowned upon, now in looking over the peer reviewed literature, it's clear that this business of trying to make the gut a little more acidic is actually one way in which people treat or try and ameliorate acid reflux. So it's kind of counterintuitive increasing acidity in the gut to try and reduce acid reflux, thought you're supposed to take antacids, well, the field has shifted quite a bit. And so we're going to review what it is to maintain the chemistry of the gut at a slightly more acidic level or a more aesthetic level, I should say, because it turns out that there are a number of things that are in gut are just call it what it is, it's gastric juice, sounds kind of gross. But gastric juices are actually powerful modulators of brain state. Put differently, one of the best things that you can do to have a healthy brain, a well-functioning brain and a healthy and well-functioning body is to maintain proper gut chemistry. And that's basically accomplished by getting the right level of acidity and alkalinity in your gut. Now this is not quack pseudoscience. This is not based on cleanses or anything of that sort. Well, we're going to talk about now are peer reviewed data in very high quality journals, like the Journal Cell, which is one of the three apex science nature, so, and journals of that sort, that point to the gut microbiome and its relationship to acidity of the gut and how the gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune function and various other aspects of brain and body health. So within all the mucosal lining tissues of our body, we have what are called microbiota, little micro organisms that we didn't make that actually come from our environment or our food and live inside us. And there are good microbiota and there are bad microbiota whether or not we have good microbiota or bad microbiota depends on one thing. And that one thing is how acid or alkaline the given mucosal tissue is. So we actually have a microbiome in our nose. And just as a very brief aside, because I'd be remiss if I didn't say this, if you emphasize nasal breathing most of the time, except when speaking or eating. And if you downplay mouth breathing, meaning you refrain from mouth breathing, especially in sleep, you improve the nasal microbiome. It gets better at fighting off infections. This was shown in a beautiful paper, published in Cell Reports last year. And that paper I should mention was performed in humans. So you've got a microbiome in your nose and my nasal breathing most of the time, not all the time. Cause there going to be times when you need to breathe through your mouth for whatever reason, hard exercise or eating or speaking, but by breathing through your nose, most of the time you are creating an additional layer of immune defense against particles that could get you sick. Whereas when you mouth breathe, you are taking down a layer of defense and you are putting yourself more at risk of infection. This is what this paper shows. You also have a gut microbiome that is in your throat, in your stomach and in your intestines. And that gut microbiome is extremely powerful in regulating your mood and your immune function. Now, this is not something that you can sense directly. You don't know when you have a bunch of good microbiota or a bunch of bad microbiota because you can feel them moving around in there, actually that would be pretty awful, that would be pretty creepy feeling. Rather that according to whether or not your gut is alkaline or acidic in the appropriate ways, you will populate your gut with the appropriate microbiota. So you want your stomach to be pretty acidic, but other elements of your digestive tract are going to be more pH. And basically there's a gradient, meaning there's a low to high pH gradient along the gut. You don't have to know what the pH should be at any one given point, because you're not going to go and put microbiota at one location and not another. What you essentially want to do is create an environment where the proper can thrive, because when you do that, you greatly decrease what are called inflammatory cytokines. So these are things that are secreted both by cells, within the body and cells within the brain to impact brain health and brain function and bodily health. They go by particular name, so there's something called TNF alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. It is inflammatory. It's not a good thing to have at elevated levels. You have something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes inflammation, causes damage to tissues, not a good thing to have elevated for long periods of time. And then you have anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin 10, which reduce inflammation. And there are hundreds of these, if not thousands of these different cytokines, some of which promote inflammation, some of which reduce inflammation. The simple way to adjust these things in the proper ratios is to adjust your gut microbiome. The best way to adjust your microbiome is to ingest certain types of foods. So there is a beautiful literature on this now, but the most important literature is the one that I referred to at the beginning of this episode, which is what to ingest and what not to ingest in terms of foods in order to create the best conditions in your gut so that you can create the best conditions in your brain and body. There was a study done by my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg at Stanford School of Medicine. Justin's actually my upstairs neighbor in the building at Stanford where I work and they explored how different foods or different diets, I should say, impact the gut microbiome and inflammatory markers. And this is a beautiful study because it was done in hundreds of human patients. These actually weren't patients that were sick, I should say human subjects that were otherwise healthy from a huge variety of backgrounds, so you had men, you had women, you had people of different races, different ethnicities. You had a huge range of backgrounds and they tracked all of that. And what they did is they explored two types of diets. One is a high fiber diet. So dietary fibers are non-digestible are only partially digestible carbohydrates typically. And they compared that to diets that were unchanged, except for the inclusion of a few, to a few more servings of fermented foods, each day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, they even explored, it sounds pretty disgusting to me, but who knows, I've never tried it, which is fermented cottage cheese. And what they found was that after initial period of a few weeks, where they had people either eat a lot of fiber or eat one or two servings of fermented foods, they had those people ramp up their ingestion of either fiber or fermented foods, so they kind of ease them into it. As they went baseline then ramp up to the point where they were ingesting, you know, four or five servings of fiber or of fermented foods per day, which sounds like a lot. But for fermented foods, that would be, you know, four or five tablespoons of sauerkraut or kimchi. It's not quite, it's not like huge platefuls of fermented foods. And then they looked at a number of things. They looked at the proteome, which is a kind of like looking at the genome, but a bunch of proteins that are made in the body. And they did this by fecal samples, by stool samples, and they did this by blood draw, which is great, it's a real power of this study. In fact, the most comprehensive study that I'm aware of. By looking at these different tissues across long periods of time, so many weeks, and then returning people to their, to the diet that they were on before they went into the study, they will were able to establish in a causal way, how ingesting fibers or fibrous foods versus ingesting these fermented foods on a daily basis could impact the gut microbiome and many inflammatory markers and many markers of immune function and auto immune function. And the takeaway message from this study is that the fermented foods far out performed the high fiber diet. In fact, the high fiber diet in some people was beneficial and in other people caused issues with inflammation. This is very different than what I was taught growing up and what many of us were taught. Interestingly they also observed that people that ate the high fiber diet had increases in certain enzymes that lend themselves to better digestion of carbohydrates. And I think there's an important insight to come from this. Nowadays we kind of live in the age of extremes where people seem to either want to be carnivore or like never ingest a vegetable, I hear they don't even like allow pepper, but they're not even allowed, you know, sauerkraut or something like very extreme or pure plant based, pure vegan or pure. So essentially pure carbohydrate or pure animal protein, very extreme. I'm an omnivore, I like to eat a mixture of different things at different times of days, but very extreme, but this is interesting because what this, what these data show is that perhaps ingesting a high carbohydrate high fiber diet, which is really what these, the high-fiber condition really was actually makes people better at digesting carbohydrates. This may explain why people who are used to a, kind of a more paleo type or carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates and say, oh, that doesn't work for me, I don't feel good. It might also explain why people who predominantly eat plant-based foods and carbohydrate foods will try eating meat as an experiment, or because they lost a bet or whatever it is and they'll do or desperation, or they'll do that. And then they'll say, oh, I don't feel good when I eat meat. How good you feel, it seems how well you can utilize that food, and how much of that food you crave may be determined in fact, it appears is determined by your food eating history, the types of food you eat. And I think this might explain some of the divide and hopefully might bridge some of the chasm between these different groups that are saying it should be one way, or it should be another. But at the core of the study was the bigger message. The bigger message is that all of us should be ingesting on a regular basis, daily basis, two to four servings of fermented foods of different kinds. And why I say that is because the inflammatory markers went down, the markers of auto-immune disruption went down, and the chemistry of the gut therefore was adjusted in the appropriate ways. Now it's not to say that high fiber is bad or that fiber is bad, I don't want people to confuse this, but even though this is a discussion about interoception, about sensing the self. This is a subconscious mechanism by which the gut communicates to many organs, including the brain. And it's been shown in other studies also in quality peer review journals that when the correct gut microbiota are present and these inflammatory markers are reduced, cognition improves so ability to focus, ability to sleep ability to ward off infection and wound healing all enhanced, in fact, even in autism spectrum disorder, in people that struggle with various mental conditions or disorders of the mind improving the gut microbiome seems to have powerful effects on improving brain symptoms. Along the lines of auto-immunity, there are a number of conditions that we call auto-immune conditions, and we will do entire episodes about these going forward. But for people with so-called irritable bowel syndrome, for people with Crohn's disease, for people with leaky gut, Hashimoto's, which is a kind of an immune system self-attack on one's thyroid gland and things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting the gut microbiome has been shown to be useful in positively adjusting the symptoms of all of those, will it fix those conditions entirely? Probably not. But can it have a significant positive impact on them? Probably, yes. There is one thing that's worth mentioning in that list, which is leaky gut, what is leaky gut. Here, we're talking about the guts, what is it to have a leaky gut, it sounds awful. It sounds like something sort of like leaking out the end of the tube, and it maybe that too, I don't know. But leaky gut is actually because, your gut is not a tube that's continuous, one cell it's actually made up of many cells and those cells form a barrier and they form what are called tight junctions. If you have two cells and you want to create a fence out of those cells, you bind them together. The way that the body does this is to bind them together with what are called tight junctions, these are, they go by names like claudins and things like that, if you want to look them up. These tight junctions form a nice barrier, like a cyclone fence, that things can't get past, but like a cyclone fence only molecules of a certain size can go through those holes. So you're not going to pass a soccer ball through an intact cyclone fence, but you could pass for instance, a feather through that fence. So leaky gut is when the conditions in the gut are too alkaline or the gut microbiota are off in the gut, meaning microbiota that like alkaline guts are living there. And those tight junctions can't function at that particular pH and you create little holes in that fence. And then what happens is when you ingest foods, some of those foods literally leak out of the gut and into the extracellular space and into the bloodstream. And because foods include proteins and antibodies react to proteins, what ends up happening in leaky gut, and the reason we talk about in auto-immune conditions is that you start developing antibodies to particular food proteins. And then people start feeling like they have food allergies and they do, they actually create particular food allergies. Now, one way to prevent leaky gut is to get the rest of the gut situation happy by ingesting the proper foods that we talked about before, ingesting fermented foods on a regular basis. The other is our old friend glutamine, again. There are some data and I should say it's a limited number of studies showing that ingesting glutamine anywhere from one to three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now, the mechanism for that still isn't clear whether or not it's adjusting pH or whether or not it's creating more favorable environment for the microbiota, but it is clear that supplementing with glutamine can, in some people enhance where I should say improve conditions of leaky gut, so that might be useful as well. And then the final thing about this, I want to talk about is we're talking about chemical sensing in the gut and how that impacts wellbeing is about gut acidity, and this I confess is a little bit controversial. Some people are on board, this other people are not. And so I'd love your feedback on this, if you, if you agree, please tell me if you disagree, please tell me, but please tell me why you disagree in particular, experience or data, although it's always better if you can point me towards peer reviewed studies. There is a practice that some people embrace. I'm not recommending people necessarily do this. And you would definitely want to talk to your doctor, but where people have food allergies or they're having mood or auto-immune issues, and they treat this, some people recommend treating this through the ingestion of HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, they literally can melt away skin. You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly, but hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form in capsule or pill form. And there is a practice of starting to ingest one or two hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal and then what people will generally do is examine to see whether or not that improves their symptoms of indigestion, how it relates to mood, how it relates to well-being, how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera. By changing the acidity, you also changed the way that the gut communicates with the brain through the mechanisms we talked about before. And there are a growing number of people embracing these practices of taking HCL. It's often combined with other things, it's usually combined with an enzyme and that enzyme is pepsin. So most of these supplements come in the form betaine HCL pepsin and while they're not a cure-all, and certainly don't want to suggest that they're a cure-all, many people that have a hard time adjusting the pH of their gut and have a hard time adjusting the microbiota of their gut in the appropriate ways have benefited from taking these betaine HCL pepsin tablets or capsules during meals. And the general instruction is to start slow, to start with one or two, and then to find a level that you're comfortable with that doesn't create an excessive feeling of warmth in the stomach, it doesn't throw off your digestion. So it takes a little bit of experimentation, again, definitely talk to your healthcare provider before exploring this, but this has become a very common practice for people with auto-immune disorders and accessing the gut because it is accessible by taking things has also become way in which people with various mental conditions are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing. Along these lines, I do want to mention that there are studies that show that people that supplement with a lot of probiotics or even prebiotics can sometimes experience brain fog. This isn't discussed a lot and the data are a little all over the place, but it is that we're thinking about. The goal here is not to create as many microbiota as possible, what you want is microbiota diversity. And I should mention this again in reference to the Sonnenberg study, which was what the high fiber diet does is it increases certain microbiota, but it limits their diversity and what the fermented food diet does, or I should say the diet that includes regular ingestion of fermented foods a few servings a day is it increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack of microbiota diversity has a name in the medical profession. It's called dysbiosis and dysbiosis is bad. Dysbiosis is what you see when people are spending long periods of time on bedrest or when they've been chronically ill, and so here again, we're talking about creating a positive environment in the gut, either by adjusting acidity, maybe you explore the betaine HCL pepsin thing. I think if you have healthy digestion, if you feel like you have a good relationship to your gut, and it has a good relationship to you, sort of a silly phrase, because it is you and you are it, then I don't think there's any need to pursue this, but if you don't, that might be one avenue to pursue. However I think primary in all of this is the fermented food findings, and it's not just one study, it's many many findings that now bring us to a place where a huge center of massive data are pointing us in the direction of saying ingest fermented foods on a regular basis. I should also mention that conditions like sarcopenia, which is the loss of muscle tissue as we age, has been shown to be offset by improving the gut microbiota. So while today is about interoception, we're talking about sensing, we're also talking about subconscious sensing. What are we talking about, subconscious sensing, we're talking about subconscious sensing of the milieu of the body. When the milieu of the gut and the body is right, than the brain and the immune system function very well. And so this isn't something where you can sit back and say, oh, you know, I feel all those good microbiota in my gut, or, oh, no, those are bad microbiota. You can't do that unless you're going to take fecal samples and blood samples and analyze them in the, with the extreme exhaustive nature that the Sonnenberg and other labs do, you're not going to get that kind of information. I know there are companies out there that do this, and I don't want to knock on any of them, but I do want to emphasize that to do this right, to really analyze which cytokines you're making, which ones you're not, you really need to look at a huge number of them. And that requires large-scale proteomic and genomic and inflammatory markers screens. It's just not the kind of thing that most commercial enterprises can really provide to people in a way that they can interpret, rather, this is a case where you can simply go to the effector, to the thing that can actually move the needle in the right direction for you. It's very clear that's fermented foods and that's keeping the stomach slightly more acid than one might think you would want to. So let's talk about barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, is when the contents of your guts run in reverse, meaning when they go up from your stomach. Sometimes even up from the intestines, even though that sounds horrible, it sometimes happens up, out the esophagus and mouth and onto whatever surface happens to be in front of you. It's a terrible thing, nobody likes to do it, but it's a very interesting aspect of our biology because it reveals a beautiful and absolutely fundamental relationship between our chemistry and our brain. So your brain is actually locked behind a gate and that gate is not your skull. That gate is the so-called blood-brain barrier. So just like your gut has these epithelial tight junctions, the things I talked about before that provide a fence, so things can't get through and get through in leaky gut, your brain has tight junctions that are very tight. It's absolutely fundamental that only certain molecules get across the blood brain barrier and that others don't. And the reason for that is that most all 99.99999% of your neurons do not regenerate, I don't care what you've read, especially in the news recently about how psychedelics cause neurogenesis, because they don't, it's absolutely wrong. Psychedelics have effects on brain plasticity, but they have nothing to do with neurogenesis, at least no data to support it, but because you can't make new neurons, you also can't damage the ones you've got, or you shouldn't as much as possible. And that's why you have a blood brain barrier or a BBB. So the BBB as it's called prevents substances from getting to the brain, however, like any fence, it is not always uniform along its length. And there are little spots within that fence where chemicals can sneak across to the brain and through a beautiful design, I don't know anything about the design. As I always say, I wasn't consulted the design phase. I'm not talking about any kind of intelligent design or anything that is not the topic of this podcast. This is not a philosophy podcast, nor is it a religion podcast, it's a science podcast, but through a beautiful design of some sort, there are little holes in that fence. And they're little neurons that sit right behind those holes and those neurons sense what the chemistry of the blood is. So I'm guessing you probably didn't imagine that today's discussion about sensing the self would be sensing your own blood, but you do. There's a little area of your brain, that's little indeed, but is very important called area postrema P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. And area postrema is an area of the brainstem that sits right next to another brain area called the chemo receptor trigger zone. And when the contents in your bloodstream are of a particular kind, meaning when there are pathogens or it's too acidic, the neurons and area postrema the neurons in the chemo receptor trigger zone, the CTZ as it's called, trigger a bunch of motor reflexes in the abdominal wall that make you barf. Okay, the feeling that you need to throw up is triggered by these neurons in the brain stem. And those neurons in the brainstem are triggered by the presence of certain chemicals. And the reason why you don't have any blood brain barrier at that location is because post-trauma has to be there like a crossing guard, making sure that everything that's coming through the blood is okay, and if it even senses just the tiniest bit, that things are off, it's going to trigger that reflex. Now, the really interesting thing is that the neurons and area postrema respond to the chemistry of the blood, but they also will respond to our consciousness, to things that we think and things that we believe and even particular memories. This is why when certain people see vomit or see someone else vomit, or even somebody else heaving, as if they're going to vomit, they themselves feel as if they're going to vomit. I'm guessing they're probably even a few of you right now that feel like you might vomit. You might feel salivation in your throat, which is always a precursor to vomiting. Some people, the memory of, or the thought of something like blood or vomit or, use your imagination, can actually trigger the vomit reflex. And that's because these neurons in area are very sensitive to prior experience of interactions with negative things. So and actually, as I'm saying this, I feel my gut kind of cramping up again, I'm not, I don't vomit very easily, I'm not one of those, nor am I somebody who's never vomited. And here we are talking about my vomit history, but I think it's appropriate in this, in this context, the neurons of area, or they're basically to keep your whole system safe and thank goodness they are, because for instance, some people, unfortunately, they drink so much alcohol that they throw up. Have you ever wondered why that is? Well it's because alcohol fundamentally is a poison. I'm not saying for, you know, age appropriate folks that ingesting alcohol is bad. This isn't a judgment call, but alcohol itself at excessive levels in the bloodstream triggers post-trauma to cause vomiting. So this is an example, whereby memories, context, but also just the chemistry of our internal state is triggering behaviors that are very hardwired. They're very reflux driven. And why would it be that some people get more nauseous than others at a given level, well, they'll have to do with alcohol tolerance. Some people have what's called a, you know, we refer to as a stronger stomach or a stomach of steel. Other people they throw out very easily if they don't feel well, or if they ingest anything that's just a little bit off. From a purely adaptive standpoint, it's probably better to vomit up things that aren't good for you rather than to have them pass through your system. Especially if those things are contained in lipids. For instance if you ingest something that's in liquid form because cells, literally every cell in your body is surrounded by a little thin layer of fatty tissue, we call the bilayer membrane, it's a little membrane. Fat can move through fat very easily. And so any bad stuff you ingest can get stuck in your system. So let's talk for a second about how to reduce nausea, because nausea is that salivation, that feeling that you're going to vomit, can be very beneficial in an, in an adaptive circumstance. Like you've ingested something bad, but some people experience nausea, for other reasons, there are good ways to regulate nausea and the ways they regulate nausea, very interesting. They actually adjust the activity of these neurons in area postrema or they change the chemistry of the blood directly. And many of you have heard this before, perhaps, but it turns out that there are good data, 11 research studies where the ones that I could find peer reviewed research studies with no bias, so independent studies showing that ginger can cause a notable reduction in nausea, how much ginger, one to three grams, what's one to three grams where you have to measure it out on a scale, unless you're taking it in pill or capsule form. It doesn't seem to matter if you take it in pill or capsule form, so this thing that you've heard before that ginger can reduce nausea, indeed is true. Peppermint, apparently can also do that. And some of you will not be surprised to learn that cannabis can reduce nausea, not surprise because cannabis, which has different legality in different places, and I understand that, so please take that into consideration. But cannabis, THC and, or it turns out CBD can reduce nausea, that's been shown in at least one study. And it probably does that, not by changing the chemistry of your blood, but by changing the threshold for firing of these neurons in area post-trauma. And there are conditions such as in chemotherapy and radiation therapy and others where people are feeling very nauseous, I'm not recommending people go use cannabis, unless they've decided with their selves and their family and their doctor that they should. But what's interesting is this thing about CBD and we'll do a whole episode on THC and CBD doesn't have, or isn't supposed to have these psychoactive properties that THC does. Although CBD can have a mild to major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, but it does appear that the data are what the data support. I should say, the anecdotal reports, which are that cannabis can reduce nausea. So to barf less, ginger, peppermint, and if appropriate and legal for you, possibly cannabis. Now let's talk about fever. In previous episodes, and in future episodes, we deal with thermal regulation, which is the body's ability to regulate its temperature. Talk about cold and heat and saunas and ice baths and physical performance. We're not going to deal with all that right now, but I promise we will going forward. Today, I only want to talk about fever because fever directly relates to interoception. What do I mean by that? Well, a fever is simply an increase in body temperature, that increase in body temperature is triggered by neurons in the brain. And those neurons in the brain are triggered by the presence of particular things in the bloodstream. What sorts of things? Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, when something bad gets in our system, the body doesn't know it's bad, it just knows it's foreign, and it hasn't seen it before. Or that it's in the wrong compartment of the body. So earlier we were talking about proteins that leak out of the gut and get elsewhere, you know, you don't want a piece of steak sitting in your bicep. That would be bad, you would actually develop antibodies, you would have a horrible infection. But your body has this intelligence, and that intelligence is to know, Hmm, these proteins are normally not seen in this region and then your body or the cells there, I should say, we'll release something that then will travel to the brain and will trigger an increase in body temperature so that your body cooks the bad thing or the cause of the bad thing. It's really a beautiful adaptive mechanism. We always think fever is so terrible, but fever is there to cook the bad thing that's inside you, or that has left the correct compartment inside you and is in the wrong compartment inside you. So what's beautiful about the fever mechanism is that it looks a lot like the barfing mechanism. Basically you have a set of neurons that sit near the ventricles, remember the ventrals is hole in the tube, that is you, the tube that is, you are a tube, a series of tubes. And your brain has a hole down the middle. And it extends down to the bottom of your spinal cord, at the front, it's called the ventricles, they start with what are called the lateral ventricles and the excuse me, starts with the third and the lateral ventricles, and then it goes to the fourth ventricle and then to what's called the central canal. But basically is just a big space in the middle of your nervous system in the middle of your brain. And you have one ventricle that I already mentioned called the third ventricle. And it's shaped kind of like a thin oval up upright, if you're listening to this, just think an I, the shape of an I, but it's kind of rotated 90 degrees. So it's up and down as opposed to across. And along that third ventricle, there's there a little neurons that can sense what's in the cerebral spinal fluid that fills the ventricle. So in other words, you have neurons that are sensing the chemistry of your cerebral spinal fluid, and that have access therefore to the chemistry of your body. Because that cerebral spinal fluid is going up and down the brain and spinal cord. But into that cerebral spinal fluid are signals about the various chemicals within the body. So this is not a mechanical system. This is a chemical system. Remember we're talking about mechanical information and chemical information accessing the brain. So if you have something bad in your system, you've ingested a, you breathe in a virus or you inhaled some bacteria, or you got a cut on your leg and some bacteria are growing there. Of course, locally, there will be effects, little things called the mast cell. This M-A-S-T little packets of histamine literally will go there and explode [poofs] and cause inflammation, which is actually a good inflammation. And we'll release little things called macrophages to gobble up the infection. The other day, it was in Texas, it was some mean little mosquitoes in Texas, and a lot of them, and I would stand outside and I'd get bitten, I didn't feel a thing, but then later that night, they started swelling up and itching and then I'd itch them, and then they'd swell even more. That was because of the release of mass cells, of histamines inside those mass cells that would literally causing inflammation of the tissue. It wasn't the poison from the mosquito itself. It was the immune response to those. Well, you also have this systemic or body-wide attempt to kill stuff, and that's the fever. So the neurons that these ventricles with cerebral spinal fluid go by a particular name, they're called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum, ventricular near the ventricles. And you have these organs and there are a set of neurons, has a really cool name called the OVLT. I don't know why I like that, but I just like it, it's the organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis, OVLT are the neurons that respond to toxins and bad stuff in your bloodstream, however minor or major. And they release things like ILK-1, which are inflammatory cytokines inflammatory in this case is good, you want inflammation at the site of an infection. It's a good thing. It's going to help with healing. And it's going to change the conditions in your body, what's going to happen is when those OVLT neurons are activated, because you have something bad in your body or something bad is happening in your body, they communicate with an area of the brain called the preoptic area of your hypothalamus and the preoptic area cranks up your temperature and tries to cook that bad thing. Now it's worth talking about fever for a moment and talking about thermal regulation, because I think this actually could save some lives. So if you are overheated to a point where, you know, you're getting up past 102 or 103, it's going to vary depending on person to person and certainly age, you know, kids, some people think can tolerate higher levels of fever than adults, but look, you always want to be cautious about heating up the brain too much, because once those neurons are gone, they do not come back and neurons do not do well in very high temperatures. Once your body temperature starts getting up to 102, 103, certainly 104, you are starting to enter serious danger zone. This can happen through exercise in hot environments or an inability to escape heat because you don't have covering or adequate ventilation or cooling. It can also be because of excessive fever, for whatever reason. A lot of people think the way to deal with this is to put a cool compress on the back of the neck or to cool the torso. In discussing this with my colleague, Craig Heller who's at Stanford School of Medicine, and he's on the undergraduate side of the campus as well, runs a biology lab. He's a world expert in thermal regulation. It's very clear that that's the wrong response to try and cool off the body. If you put a cold towel or you put an ice pack on the back of the neck, what you effectively do is cool the blood that's going to the brain. And if you do that, then your brain will react by turning up the crank in so to speak on the neurons in the pre optic area, and will heat you up further and can cook your brain and organs further. So what you want to do is, as I've talked about before, you want to cool the bottoms of the feet, the palms of the hands and the upper part of the face. And I'm not going to go into all the details as to why you want to do that right now, but those are the locations you want to cool. Now you can also cool the rest of the body, but it's not okay to just stay under the covers and just cool, you know, the neck or something like that. You really want to try and create a systemic or whole body cooling, if the goal is to bring fever down, but in many cases, fever is adaptive. And so taking a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil and Tylenol sometimes can be good, if that's recommended, but other times, because it reduces your fever, it's allowing that pathogen, that pyrogen, it's sometimes called, a pyrogen is a substance that causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think pyromaniacs, think pyro, those pyrogens can survive at moderate to low temperatures, and they can't survive at high temperatures. So the fever is an adaptive mechanism and the OVLT, and the sensing of your chemistry is how the OVLT, organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis does that. So we've talked about sensing lung volume, speed of our heartbeat, we talked about sensing the gut volume, the intestinal volume, or the absence of volume. We talked about chemistry of the gut and the gut microbiota and auto immune functions. And we've now talked about vomiting, and we've talked about fever, lots of aspects of sensing our internal self. Now I want to turn our attention to interoception as it relates to feelings, the way that interoception is most commonly described. And I want to highlight a term that many of you have probably heard, which is the vagus nerve. We talked about vagus a little bit earlier, but the vagus nerve, this vagabonding wandering nerve is involved in everything I've talked about up until now. And the reason I saved it till now, rather than mentioning all along is to highlight a specific point, which is that whenever we hear about the vagus in popular culture, it's like the vagus calms you down, you want to stimulate the vagus by rubbing in front of the ear, and it's a parasympathetic nerve, and it will calm you down, he'll mellow you out. Actually, most of the time, the vagus is stimulatory. When you ingest foods with amino acids, sugars, or fatty acids, the vagus nerve gets activated and triggers the release of dopamine, it makes you more alert and go seek more of those foods or what led to those conditions. When you feel nauseous it's rarely calming, when you feel like you have a fever, it's rarely calming. So you're starting to get the picture that even though the vagus nerve is in the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. And if that doesn't mean anything to you, because you're not in aficionado, don't worry about it. But it's not a calming system, it's a communication system, and it's a motor system. It communicates brain to body and body to brain, and it changes the function of different organs, now, one thing that's important to highlight is that stress itself will alter the chemistry of your gut because of the ways that it down the vagus nerve and quiets the neurons that communicate from gut to brain. I want to say that again, stress will disrupt your gut and make you feel not good, poor digestion, and just lousy, because of the way that it shuts down the vagus nerve and the neurons of your gut. So what stress does is it blocks the communication between gut and brain, it doesn't mess up your gut. It just doesn't let your gut get the signals up to your brain, and it also then throws off the chemistry. And then there's a whole cascade of effects. If you want to learn more about stress, I did a whole episode called \"Master Stress,\" or I think maybe it was called \"Conquer Stress\" and it was \"Master Stress,\" either one. The whole point of that episode is to give you tools and practices to deal with short term, acute stress, moderate term stress, and long-term chronic stress through behavioral mechanisms, nutrition, supplementation, and many other things as well. It's chockablock full of protocols and tools for stress. The vagus nerve, however, is responsible for emotion and the way it does that is to pool, to aggregate the conditions of your gut, the conditions of your heart and the conditions of your breathing, which includes your diaphragm and lungs and takes that kind of as a collection of information and sends it to the brain and controls what we call your emotions. Now that might seem obvious to some people, but to other people that might seem totally crazy. You thought your emotions were because the market was down and you had invested, or because something that you thought was going to happen is not going to happen, or because you thought that school was open and then it's not, or maybe thought it wasn't, and it is whatever it is that bothers you, you think of generally as a purely cognitive event. But the brain doesn't really know what to do with that information. It doesn't act directly on that information to create moods. Moods are created through the heart's response to reading that headline, to the change in your breathing, that's caused by someone that you love telling you that actually they're not interested in spending time with you anymore, or that you screwed up or that they're interested in spending a lot of time with you and you like that, right? Emotions can be good or bad or neutral. So this thing that we call interoception, the sense of self I've been building up from very fundamental layers, gut chemistry, spleens, immune systems, auto-immune and you might've been thinking, wait, I thought this was going to be about a sense of self, a noticing or a feeling. And indeed all of those things are plugging in like a series of ingredients in a recipe that gives rise to your mood and how you feel, and that mood and how you feel is shown in one location in your body that other people can see. And that's in your facial expressions. And indeed there are now beautiful data showing that your face, including the size of your pupils, the tonality of your face, how flushed you are, or how pale you are, even the degree to which you're frowning or smiling relative to other periods of time, that is all an aggregate of, or a reflection rather of your gut, your heart and your breathing and the chemistry of your body. And so this is why I sort of backed into this conversation about interoception I kind of Trojan horse this on you on purpose which is that when we talk about the vagus and you hear, oh, you know, you can get vagal tone by breathing or rubbing on the front of the or short that's probably true, but another fundamental layer is the acidity of your gut, how fast your breathing are you inhale-emphasized, or exhale-emphasized breathing. When we are relaxed our pupils tend to constrict. When we are very alert, our pupils tend to be dilated, whether or not that alertness has to do with being happy or being sad. And what's remarkable, and this is where interoception really takes a leap into the incredible is that there are beautiful studies that show that for instance, when we know somebody pretty well and they are going through some sort of experience of any kind, our heart rate actually starts to mimic their heart rate. Our breathing starts to mimic their breathing, even if we aren't conscious of their breathing. It's not like we see their chest heaving, and we think, oh my goodness, and then we breathe that way. There's a mirroring and no it's not carried out through mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are more of a myth and a reality, sorry to burst people's bubbles. But that bubble around mirror neurons is definitely made of myths and a topic for another time, but we start to mirror. Somehow human beings are able to register the internal state of other beings, and I think probably for animals too, but certainly for other humans, even at a distance. And these studies are many now, and they're really wonderful studies. And so your sense of your internal landscape is linked to others. Now you can enhance this interoceptive capacity for how you feel and how others feel, in other words, you can start getting a better readout of your internal state by doing a simple exercise, what is really a tool. And that is to learn to sense your heartbeats. So some people are very good at this, other people are not, some people can do this more easily when they have all their air exhaled and some people can do it better when they are holding a breath hold. But one thing that's kind of cool about this whole interoceptive capacity is that you can enhance it very quickly. You can learn or teach yourself to have heightened levels of interoception in a way that you can't really just give yourself heightened levels of vision by snapping your fingers, in one of one tool or exercise, there are things you can do to improve vision. That's the topic of a previous episode. I encourage you to look it up. There are things you can do to improve your hearing and your taste and your smell, we talked about all those, but with interoception you can get very good at this very fast. And I think this is one of the reasons why meditation is powerful. Think there are a lot of reasons why meditation is powerful, but one of the reasons is when you stop taking in exteroceptive information from the outside world, by closing your eyes and focusing inward, as they say, you start paying attention to your breathing cadence, you start directing your mind's attention to your heart rate, and if you can start to perceive your heart beating. You actually are very quickly strengthen the vagal connections between the body and the brain. And so there's no real practice here. There's no breathe this way or do this thing except to direct your awareness toward your heartbeat. And some people can get very good at this very fast. Most people find that just by doing this for a minute or so, every once in a while, they start to tap into this sixth sense. They start to notice when they don't feel quite right about something or somebody or some situation, or they start to notice when they feel quite right about somebody or something or some situation. So this interoceptive awareness can be tuned up. It used to be called vagal tone, but I think that term doesn't take into account all the other things that are going on with the vagus. So I don't really like that term. It's more of an interoceptive awareness. And again, there are many studies now showing that for sake of bettering one's mood overall, for sake of moving through a challenging phase in life, for sake of just enhancing one's experience of life overall, whether or not it's the taste of foods, interactions with other people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning up one's interoceptive awareness is both easy again by just taking a minute or two and trying to count heartbeats. And then this works best, of course, if you have some independent readout of heartbeats and you can compare, you can see how accurate you are, but even if you don't use a device or have a device to do that, without taking your pulse, using your thumb on your wrist or something, or your fingers on your neck, as you typically would for taking your pulse, trying to sit still for a minute or two every once in a while, maybe once a week, maybe twice a week, maybe while you're meditating, maybe while breathwork, maybe during the breath holds of breathwork, you don't really have to do this in any kind of extended way, you can very quickly increase your interoceptive tone. And that has a huge and outsized effect on the brain, body relationship and your brain's ability to tap into both the subconscious and the conscious aspects of this chemical and mechanical signaling that's happening all the time. And it can have real and out-sized positive effects on your ability to engage with other people and your ability to focus at work and your ability to notice, ah, I'm finding myself kind of feeling like I'm losing focus, but really it was my heart rate was just increasing. Maybe I just exhale a little bit and bring my heart rate down. So whatever effectually tried to do today is to give you a window into this incredible relationship between your viscera and your brain and your brain and your viscera, all these organs of your body, and what I hope is that you'll appreciate that it's a system, that you aren't just a system of tubes. I said that in a sort of in jest, I mean, you have a lot of tubes and you are a system of tubes, but that system of tubes is linked through the nervous system, and those links work in very specific ways. So whether or not you remember about pesos and all the GLPRs and all that stuff, it doesn't really matter. What I encourage you to do is start sort of pushing and pulling on the various leavers within this beautiful system that we call the interoceptive system, this sense of self.

During the course of today's episode, and on previous episodes, I mentioned supplements. I realized supplements aren't for everybody, but for those of you that are interested in supplements, it is important that the supplements that you take have a high level of stringency with respect to the amounts of the contents that are listed on the bottle matching what's actually in the bottle, in the capsules and tablets, and that the quality of those ingredients be extremely high. For that reason we partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E because Thorne supplements have the highest levels of stringency for both the content and the amount of content in those bottles and supplements. If you want to try Thorne supplements, and you want to see the supplements that I take, you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman. And you can see all the supplements that I take. You can get 20% off any of those. And if you enter the Thorne site through that portal, you can get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

    "rawText": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an ask me anything or AMA episode, which is part of our premium subscriber content. Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which still comes out once a week every Monday and, of course, is zero cost to consumer. The premium channel is also designed to support exciting research being done at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere, research that's done on humans that should lead to protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance in the near future. If you'd like to check out the premium channel subscription model, you can go to hubermanlab.com/premium, and there you can subscribe for $10 a month or $100 a year. We also have a lifetime subscriber option. For those of you that are already Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers and you're watching and/or hearing this, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the premium podcast feed. And for those of you that are not already Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers, you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so of this episode, and hopefully, that will allow you to discern whether or not you would like to become a premium subscriber. Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet, as concise as possible. Our first question is about motivation, in particular, how to maintain motivation over long periods of time. This was the question asked by Martin Zokov. He wrote, \"I alternate between periods of two different states that vary from a few weeks to a couple of months. I have extremely high motivation in one state, where I can do multiple things-- side projects, making music, as well as my main things, or really low-motivational states, where I can barely do anything, and I only look for short term entertainment.\" I'm guessing, short-term entertainment comes in the form of video games, social media, and just doing generally unproductive things, as we all do from time to time. He goes on to write, \"What would be the best set of protocols to normalize those extremes into a more stable and consistent state?\" Well, first off, this is an excellent question. I say that because it's a question that I hear a lot, and I think that many people are interested in knowing how motivated they ought to feel. And I think a lot of people also feel a lot less motivated than they would like. Now, here the question was, specifically, about how to not go from these extremes of days or weeks of high motivation to days or weeks of low motivation. But before we do that, we need to take a step back and acknowledge that, just as with anxiety, or happiness, or sadness, we as human beings don't have an objective window into how other people experience motivation. In fact, most of the time, we don't even realize how we experience motivation. We just know whether or not we feel a high barrier or a low barrier to leaning into work and getting things done. In fact, I have a good friend who did many years in the special operations community, and then went on to the finance community, and then now works in health and wellness community. He has a great mental image for all of us to adopt. It's certainly one that I've adopted, which is-- for anything in our life, we can either be back on our heels, flat footed, or forward center of mass. Back in our heels, meaning really struggling; flat footed, meaning we're doing OK; or forward center of mass, meaning that we feel as if we're really tackling things and that we are in control of our environment or at least to some degree. So I place that imagery in your mind because I'll return to it a little bit later in the question when we get into some of the underlying circuitry and tools. In the meantime, I want to remind everybody what the basis of motivation is. There are many neurochemicals and neural circuits involved in what we call motivation, but a central theme of the neuroscience of motivation is that the neural modulator dopamine is involved. Now, dopamine does other things besides control motivation. In fact, it controls light adaptation in the retina, that is your eye. It controls a number of different things in terms of movement. It controls all sorts of things, but it is strongly related to the motivation pathways. How do we know that? Well, there are experiments on animals and humans, which show that even in the absence of dopamine, or in the presence of very low dopamine, I should say, people and animals can still experience pleasure. However, when dopamine levels are too low, people's ability to pursue pleasure, or their willingness to pursue pleasure, in particular, their willingness to undergo effort to pursue pleasure or any goal of any kind, not just pleasure, any goal of any kind, is strongly regulated by the levels of dopamine. So if dopamine levels are too low, people simply will not put in the effort to obtain or reach a goal. If dopamine levels are adequately high, they will put in that effort. And if dopamine levels go too high, you actually see something that is pathologic, which is that people consider every goal a reasonable goal. This is often seen in the manic phase of a manic bipolar person. So for instance, somebody with manic bipolar who is in a manic episode, dopamine levels are very, very high, and they will think every idea is a great idea. And they will have tons of energy to do that, so much so so that they're not sleeping. So obviously, that's not what we want. What we want, and what the question asker, Martin, is asking about, is how to keep dopamine levels in a range that allow us to lean into effort but that we don't expend our ability to stay motivated. And we can really trace that back to a biochemical/neural circuit statement, which is-- we really want to control our output of dopamine and the baseline levels of dopamine from which that output is taken. In other words, we want to think about dopamine as a reservoir or residing in a reservoir. That reservoir can be depleted, so it's exhaustible, it's depletable, but it's renewable as well. And one of the best analogies that I've ever heard was by a previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Kyle Gillett, who's a medical doctor, obesity specialist, expert in hormones. We did an episode on optimizing hormones in males with Dr. Kyle Gillett. You can find that at hubermanlab.com or anywhere you can find podcasts. Dr. Gillett offered an analogy of the baseline levels of dopamine as a wave pool, and I really like this. So if you think about this pool full of dopamine-- and here we're just talking about the dopamine that resides in the circuits of the brain that control motivation. But that pool of dopamine you could imagine is just sitting there not doing much of anything while you're asleep. In fact, while you're sleeping, you're replenishing those dopamine levels. I'll tell you another tool in a moment to replenish those dopamine levels. But if you were to pursue a goal, really, really go forward-center of mass for many, many hours or many, many days, in some cases, and pursue a goal or multiple goals and you're really driven to do a ton, what you're effectively doing is generating waves in that wave pool. And if those waves are too big, well, then the waves can't keep repeating themselves. So think about the wave as the motivation and the depth of the pool is the reservoir of dopamine. And if those waves are too big, too much excitement, too much motivation, too much center of mass for a given period of time, then the water in this wave pool sloshes out of the wave pool lowering the reservoir. And then there are really three ways that you can replenish that reservoir, and you want to maintain or replenish that reservoir if it's been depleted. How do you do that? Well, first of all, quality sleep. So when I say quality, I mean where you're getting enough slow wave sleep and rapid I move in sleep. So for some people, six hours, for some people, eight hours. Some people might even need a little bit more or a little bit less. We have episodes-- the Perfect Your Sleep episode, the Master Your Sleep episode. We have a toolkit for sleep. All available at zero cost at hubermanlab.com, links et cetera. So check those out for getting your sleep right. But sleep is really when you replenish that reservoir of dopamine. So you cannot ignore sleep. I'll come back to this in a moment. The second science supported tool that's really been shown to replenish dopamine, in particular, dopamine within the pathways that regulate motivation, is a practice I've talked about before on the podcast called non-sleep deep rest, sometimes called yoga nidra, although, yoga nidra is a little bit different. There are two studies out of Denmark that have explored yoga nidra in the context of dopamine. The first one simply involved having people do a yoga nidra practice. Again, this doesn't involve any movement, but it involves people, potentially you, doing anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, although there are now data showing that as short as 10 minutes of a non-sleep deep rest, a.k.a. yoga nidra protocol, leads to dramatic, really dramatic increases in striatal dopamine reserves. So it essentially is replenishing the dopamine reserve pool. This is why I'm such a fan of using NSDR, a.k.a. yoga nidra, at least once a day and especially under times when you're engaging in a lot of high output. And when I say, especially at times when you're engaging in a lot of high output, this is a mistake many people make. They push, push, push, push, push. They're in pursuit of a goal. Then they hit that point where they're exhausted. Then they start doing all the dopamine reserve pool replenishing tools such as yoga nidra or NSDR. The real key is to always tap off that or refill that reservoir once a day before it's completely depleted. Now, this gets into some of the biochemistry of dopamine and the relevant circuits, but it takes a lot longer to restore the dopamine reservoir-- think of it still as a wave pool, but that reservoir from a place of complete depletion then it does of partial depletion. So there's an asymmetry in the way this is done. So it's not as if you drink a glass of water. You fill the glass of water at a certain rate and it fills up to a certain level, and the rate is constant. Think about it as once the level of dopamine in your reserve is depleted past a certain point, it takes a lot more effort, much more sleep, much more NSDR, things of that sort to replenish that reservoir. Now, oftentimes what people will do when they start feeling less motivation is they will start relying on things like Adderall, Ritalin, some cases illegal substances that can increase dopamine. You know what those are. Please don't ever lean in to those. They are extremely dangerous. They really are because of their ability to potently release dopamine. And guess what, deplete that reservoir even further. We've talked about some supplements on the podcast that can replenish dopamine, L-tyrosine in particular. Mucuna pruriens is actually 99% l-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine. I don't necessarily recommend Mucuna pruriens. It tends to make people very dopaminergic-- drive, drive, drive, drive, motivated, and then crash. Again, depleting that pool. L-tyrosine is a little bit milder. But I really encourage people to lean first on the behavioral tools such as an NSDR. And by the way, there's a NSDR script, totally zero cost, that you can find by putting my name and NSDR into YouTube. That one works quite well if you are looking for a short NSDR. There are some other NSDRs. You can simply look on the internet or YouTube and just put NSDR and you'll find NSDR. Or if you prefer to do the more classic yoga nidra type approach, there are a lot of different yoga nidra options to choose from on YouTube. Many people think NSDR or yoga nidra are simply meditation with a body scan. That's not true. Meditation is a focus exercise. Most meditations are focus exercise. NSDR restores energy through the dopamine system, and newer data are starting to show that it can actually recover lost sleep, so if you're not sleeping enough. But to return to NSDR, a.k.a. yoga nidra, as a practice, yes, it's been shown in laboratory studies, in humans, by the way, to restore dopamine levels. There's another study, lesser known, from that same group that was published in 2011, which is entitled Dopaminergic stimulation enhances confidence and accuracy in seeing rapidly presented words. This was a cognitive task. They explored yoga nedra, a.k.a. NSDR, in the context of increasing striatal dopamine. They already knew that it did that, so that's great. They confirmed that result. But what they also found is that doing NSDR could restore confidence in cognitive ability and performance in these cognitive tasks. So this is a really powerful, zero cost tool for re-upping or replenishing that dopamine reserve. So this is something to do every day, especially when you're not feeling depleted. So the question, again, was about how to make sure that you don't go through these cycles of extreme motivation and then lesser motivation. Well, get your sleep right. I always say, 80% or more of the nights of your life, hopefully the nights that it's not good, are for good reasons that you're enjoying yourself. But hey, life happens, so 100% of the time it's just not reasonable to expect of yourself. Do NSDR once a day for either 10 minutes. If you have the time to do 20-30 minutes or an hour, you will see even more positive effects. It has been shown in these research studies to replenish dopamine, levels of confidence, cognitive ability, et cetera, and sense of motivation. And I said there were three tools, and the third tool that really can allow you to keep the dopamine, a.k.a. motivation circuitry, tuned up properly is to really start paying attention to peaks in dopamine and be very careful about layering in too many things that can stimulate the dopamine system. I talked about this quite a bit in the episode that we did on ADHD and building and maintaining focus. There are many things out there nowadays that will deplete the dopamine system. For instance-- and by the way, none of what I'm about to list is necessarily bad. I actually used some of these things. For instance, caffeine will increase dopamine receptors that will allow whatever dopamine is available to be more potent. OK, so caffeine is great for some people, less good for people with anxiety. Don't drink it too late in the day because it will interfere with your sleep, and so on and so forth. But many people will combine caffeine with music that they particularly like. Music's great. Music can stimulate dopamine release, we know this. It can enhance motivation, especially if is the kind of music that really puts you in the groove for the particular type of work you're going to do. For me, I like to listen to either loud fast music or Glenn Gould classical piano, so one or the other. I know what's right for me for a given time. You'll know what's right for you for a given time and your preferences. But what will happen is people will start consuming caffeine at higher and higher levels. Again, caffeine isn't necessarily bad, but they'll start doing that. And they'll start layering it in, or stacking, very potent music, potent for them, plus things like L-tyrosine. Again, none of these things are terrible on their own. In fact, they can be very beneficial. Sometimes they'll start taking Mucuna pruriens. Sometimes they'll start relying on things like Adderall, Ritalin. And pretty soon what's happening is they're getting these big waves in that dopamine wave pool, big peaks. And within a few days or maybe even within a few hours, they're depleted and they're at that low. And then, as Dr. Anna Lembke, who is a guest on the podcast, talked about in terms of addiction but also in her wonderful book Dopamine Nation, what happens is after those big peaks in dopamine, the reservoir, the baseline in dopamine, drops below its initial level. So it's as if the reservoir got deeper, and it's emptier, and it takes much, much longer to fill. So to be quite specific, what I'm recommending is get your sleep right. Ideally, every night of your life, but for as many nights of your life as possible. That's clearly replenishing dopamine and sense of motivation. Do all the things associated with that-- morning, sunlight, lack of artificial light at certain hours of the night, et cetera. All of that's in the Toolkit for Sleep and other episodes I mentioned before. Have a practice that is research supported to replenish dopamine, and incorporate that practice any time of day. Again, NSDR can be done morning, afternoon, or evening, or middle of the night if you wake up and you need to get back to sleep, it can be very beneficial for that. But do it as a consistent practice so that dopamine reservoir remains tapped off. And as a third point, please be wary of, or at least aware of, these peaks in dopamine and the fact that layering in a lot of things that stimulate dopamine, well, that can be wonderful for your wedding, birth of a new child, going to a sports event with a bunch of friends, celebrating a big anniversary. Yes, please do celebrate and enjoy the wonderful events of life, but please also understand and expect there will be a lull, a sort of postpartum low, maybe not full blown depression, that follows that unless you incorporate some tools and practices to replenish that dopamine. Does that mean you should never combine caffeine, L-tyrosine, music, and a workout, and time with friends? No, absolutely not. But don't expect to do that, and then go do an intense bout of work, and then get up the next morning and do it all over again for more than a few days before you find yourself pretty depleted. So rather than give you a specific schedule of do seven days of this and four days of this, what I encourage you to do is, for at least five days a week-- maybe give yourself some time off on the weekends, maybe not. But for at least five days a week, get into a consistent routine that is, I should say, neurobiologically consistent as well with how the dopamine, a.k.a. circuits that control motivation, work. And I assure you that you will find yourself in a more regular groove of focus, and attention, and alertness, and motivation when you need to. And provided you're doing all the things I described, and hopefully paying attention to other things like nutrition and social connection too, of course, you'll find a much more even pattern of motivation over time. One last thing before I conclude the answer to this question. When I was in graduate school, I got some wonderful advice from an excellent neurologist. His name is Robert Knight. He used to be at University of California, Berkeley. I think he's retired now but is still active in the scientific community. And I asked him what he was doing that weekend. I don't know why this came up. And he said, oh, I'm going fishing. I like mindless recreation. I said, that's great. You know, fishing is fun. I'm not particularly into fishing myself, but I've done it a few times and I enjoy it. And he said, the most important thing for a science or medicine career or any demanding career? I said, what? I was all ears, super hungry to get in the mix and do research and publish papers. And he said, figure out how many hours a day you can do real work consistently. That means five days a week, for some people six or seven, but five days a week I think for most people is going to be a bit healthier overall for your social life and family, et cetera. And he said, figure that out, and know that that number is what you should apply over, and over, and over again, but update that number about every four or five years. And I said, OK, so does that mean that over time I'm working more and more or less and less? And he said, ah, here's the deal-- as you get better at your profession, you will find that you can do more potent work, more directed work, in a shorter amount of time, but that does not mean that you can continue to expand the amount of time that you're doing focused work. In fact, the opposite. So this follows a sort of general principle that's also present in resistance training, weightlifting, right? The analogy there is that people always imagine that as you get better and better at resistance training that you should do more and more volume, just keep adding volume. And there's some evidence to support that. More volume for hypertrophy as opposed to less, et cetera. We've done episodes on this. However, there's a different school of thought that works exceedingly well, and it runs in the exact opposite direction, which is as you get better at controlling muscular contractions-- or let's say for in an endurance sport, as you get better at regulating your stride, and breathing, and all those things, you actually can do more \"adaptation\" stimulating damage during a given training session. So you want to train less not more over time because beginners don't actually have the ability to get much done in a lot of time or a short period of time, whereas, experts can come in there and really nail it. So I think that advice that Robert Knight was really key, and it's something that I've followed throughout my career. So at one period of my life, I won't mention the hours that I worked in graduate school, they were pretty insane to be honest. I had family members get a little concerned. I actually lived in the laboratory even as a junior professor. I don't suggest people do that by the way, but I enjoyed it at the time. And the key thing is that you figure out what you can do consistently and still maintain mental health and physical health. That's key as well. And do that, and then, every couple of years or so, update that, typically, by reducing the total amount of time that you're doing that high-potency work. I think that, combined with the other tools that I described before for generating ongoing dopaminergic circuits, keeping that reservoir full, ought to give you consistent motivation. Again, it's an art, and a practice, and a science, so don't expect to get it perfect the first time around. But I wish you all luck, and I'm certain that these tools work. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research. In particular, research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree as a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel but through all channels-- Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, and especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMA's. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMA's and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]",

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science, and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are discussing memory. In particular, how to improve your memory. Now the study of memory is one that dates back many decades, and by now there's a pretty good understanding of how memories are formed in the brain. The different structures involved and some of the neuro chemicals involved. And we will talk about some of that today. Often overlooked, however, is that memories are not just about learning. Memories are also about placing your entire life into a context. And that's because what's really special about the brain and in particular the human brain, is its ability to place events in the context of past events, the present, and future events. And sometimes even combinations of the past and present. Or present and future and so on. So when we talk about memory what we're really talking about is how your immediate experiences relate to previous and future experiences. Today I'm going to make clear how that process occurs. Even if you don't have a background in biology or psychology, I promise to put it into language that anyone can access and understand. And we are going to talk about the science that points to specific tools for enhancing learning and memory. We're also going to talk about unlearning and forgetting. There are of course incidences in which we would like to forget things. And that too is a biological process for which great tools exist. To, for instance, eliminate or at least reduce the emotional load of a previous experience that you really did not like, or that perhaps even was traumatic to you. So today you're going to learn about the systems in the brain and body that establish memories. You're going to learn why certain memories are easier to form than others. And I'm going to talk about specific tools that are grounded in not just one, not just a dozen, but well over 100 studies in animals and humans that point to specific protocols that you can use in order to stamp down learning of particular things more easily. And you can also leverage that same knowledge to better forget or unload the emotional weight of experiences that you did not like. We're also going to discuss topics like deja vu and photographic memory. And for those of you that do not have a photographic memory, and I should point out that I do not have a photographic memory, either. Well, you will learn how to use your visual system in order to better learn visual and auditory information. There are protocols to do this grounded in excellent peer reviewed research. So while you may not have a true photographic memory, by the end of the episode you will have tools in hand, or I should say, tools in mind or in eyes and mind, to be able to encode and remember specific events better than you would otherwise. Before we begin I would like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking. Many times on this podcast I've talked about the incredible relationship between temperature and sleep as well as temperature and wakefulness. Many people aren't aware of this, but waking up in the morning is in part the consequence of your body heating up. And falling asleep at night and remaining in deep sleep is in part the consequence of your body temperature dropping by one to three degrees. So it's vitally important that the temperature of your sleeping environment is controlled. I've had trouble over the years falling and staying asleep. Or I should say, falling asleep hasn't been so much of an issue for me, but waking up two or three or four hours later has been an issue. Often times I'm too warm, I need to open a window. I need to adjust the temperature of the room and so on. Eight Sleep mattress covers are terrific because you can program the specific patterns of temperature that you want in your bed, or I should say below you, coming from the mattress, throughout the night. So I've programmed my Eight Sleep to put my mattress into a state of coolness in order to fall asleep. And then to get slightly cooler as the night goes on. To get into even deeper sleep. And then to warm up as morning approaches. Now, as mentioned before, Eight Sleep mattresses can be used for cooling and heating. So some of you may actually need to heat your mattress and Eight Sleep's terrific for that. For me, I use Eight Sleep to keep the mattress really cool. And I have to say, even though I thought I was sleeping pretty well before, I have not experienced the sort of sleep that I've been getting with Eight Sleep until now. By creating this descending temperature in the beginning part of the night, cooler, cooler, cooler. And then warming up towards morning. It even has a nice little vibration function so I wake up now to a slightly vibrating bed. And the sleep that I'm getting is just amazing. And I feel so much better during the day as a consequence.

Thesis makes custom nootropics. And to be quite honest, I don't like the word nootropics. Because nootropics means smart drugs. And there really isn't a neuroscience of smart. Of course, there is this notion of intelligence, but we now know there are lots of different forms of intelligence. Also, as a neuroscientist, we don't really think about intelligence, we think about those particular types of operations that you want your brain to perform in different contexts. So for instance, some tasks and life experiences require that you remember information better. Other tasks and life experiences and forms of learning involve focus and task switching. Others creativity, and so on, and so on. So the word nootropics is too much of a catchall or throw away phrase to appeal to me. Thesis understands this. And what they've done is they've created nootropics that are each designed toward a particular end goal. For instance, they have blends for focus. Blend for motivation. A blend for clarity. They use only the highest quality ingredients. Things like Alpha GPC and phosphatidyl serine. I've been using Thesis for close to six months now and I can confidently say their nootropics have been a game changer for me. I often take the clarity formula prior to long bouts of work, meaning cognitive work. And the energy formula prior to physical workouts. To get your own personalized nootropics starter kit, you can go online to TakeThesis.com/Huberman.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done. For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be assessed from a quality blood test. One of the challenges with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you'll get the numbers back. You'll get information about your blood lipids and hormones and so forth. But there are no directives as to what to do with that information. InsideTracker has solved that problem by creating a very easy to use dashboard. So you'll get your numbers back and you see what's in range and what's out of range. And then they will point you to specific nutritional supplementation and behavioral tools that will allow you to bring those numbers into the proper ranges for you. And I find that immensely beneficial because just having a bunch of data without any knowledge of what to do with that data is more overwhelming than having no data at all, frankly.

Okay, let's talk about memory. And let's talk about how to get better at remembering things. Now in order to address both of those things we need to do a little bit of brain science 101 review. And I promise this will only take two minutes. And I promise that even if you don't have a background in biology, it will make sense. We are constantly being bombarded with physical stimuli. Patterns of touch on our skin, light to our eyes, light to our skin, for that matter. Smells, tastes, and sound waves. In fact, if you can hear me saying this right now, well, that's the consequence of sound waves arriving into your ears through headphones, a computer, or some other speaker device. Each one of and all of those sensory stimuli are converted into electricity and chemical signals by your so-called nervous system. Your brain, your spinal cord, and all their connections with the organs of the body. And all the connections of your organs of the body back to your brain and spinal cord. One of the primary jobs of your nervous system, in fact, is to convert physical events in the world that are non-negotiable, right? Photons of light are photons of light. Sound waves are sound waves. There's no changing that. But your nervous system does change that. It converts those things into electrical signals and chemical signals which are the language of your nervous system. Now just because you're being bombarded with all this sensory information and it's being converted into a language that neurons and the rest of your nervous system can understand, does not mean that you are aware of it all. In fact, you are only going to perceive a small amount of that sensory information. For instance, if you can hear me speaking right now you are perceiving my voice but you are also, most likely, neglecting the feeling of the contact of your skin with whichever surface you happen to be sitting or standing on. So it is only by perceiving a subset, a small fraction of the sensory events in our environment, that we can make sense of the world around us. Otherwise we would just be overwhelmed with all the things that are happening in any one given moment. Now memory is simply a bias in which perceptions will be replayed again in the future. Anytime you experience something, that is the consequence of specific chains of neurons, that we call neural circuits, being activated. And memory is simply a bias in the likelihood that specific chain of neurons will be activated again. So for instance, if you can remember your name and I certainly hope that you can, well, that means that there are specific chains of neurons in your brain that represent your name and when those neurons connect with one another and communicate electrically with one another in a particular sequence, you remember your name. Were that particular chain of neurons to be disrupted, you would not be able to remember your name. Now this might seem immensely simple, but it raises this really interesting question which we've talked about before. Which is, why do we remember certain things and not others? Because according to what I've just said, as you go through life, you're experiencing things all the time. You're constantly being bombarded with sensory stimuli. Some of those sensory stimuli you perceive, and only some of those perceptions get stamped down as memories. Today I'm going to teach you how certain things get stamped down as memories. And I'm going to teach you how to leverage that process in order to remember the information that you want far better. Now, even though I've told you that a memory is simply a bias in the likelihood that a particular chain of neurons will be activated in a particular sequence again and again, it doesn't operate on its own. In fact, most of what we remember takes place in a context of other events. So for instance, you can most likely remember your name and yet you're probably not thinking about when it was that you first learned your name. This generally happens when we are very, very young children. And yet, I'm guessing you could probably remember a time when someone mispronounced your name, or made fun of or name. Or, as the case was for me, I got to the 3rd grade and there were two Andrews. And sadly for me, I lost the coin flip that allowed me to keep Andrew. And from about 3rd grade until about 12th grade people called me Andy. Which I really did not prefer. So if you call me Andy in the comments, I'll delete your comment. Just kidding, doesn't bother me that much. But eventually I reclaimed Andrew as my name. Well, it was mine to begin with and throughout, but I started going by Andrew again. Why do I say this? Well, there's a whole context to my name for me. And there may or not be a whole context to your name for you. But presumably, if you asked your parents why they named you your given name, you'll get a context, etc. That context reflects the activation of other neural circuits that are also related to other events in your life. Not just your name, but probably your siblings names and who your parents are. And on, and on, and on. And so, the way memory works is that each individual thing that we remember or that we want to remember is linked to something by either a close, a medium, or a very distant association. This turns out to be immensely important. I know many of you will read or will encounter programs that are designed to help you enhance your memory. You know, you have these phenoms that can remember 50 names in a room full of people. Or they can remember a bunch of names of novel objects or maybe even in different languages, and often times that's done by association. So people will come up with little mental tricks to either link the sound of a word or the meaning of a word in some way that's meaningful for them and will enhance their memory. That can be done and is impressive when we see it and for those of you who can do that, congratulations. Most of us can't do that, or at least it requires a lot of effort and training. However, there are things that we can do that leverage the natural biology of our nervous system to enhance learning and memory of particular perceptions, and particular information. Let's first just talk about the most basic ways that we learn and remember things and how to improve learning and memory. And the most basic one is repetition. Now the study of memory and the role of repetition actually dates back to the late 1800s, early 1900s when Ebbinghaus developed the first so-called learning curves. Now learning curves are simply what results when you quantify how many repetitions of something are required in order to remember something. In fact, it's been said that Ebbinghaus liberated the understanding of learning from the philosophers by generating these learning curves. What do we mean by that? Well, before Ebbinghaus came along, learning and memory were thought to be philosophical ideas. Ebbinghaus came along and said, well, let's actually take some measurements. Let's measure how well I can remember a sequence of words or a sequence of numbers if I just repeat them. So what Ebbinghaus did is he would take a sequence of numbers, or words on a page and he would read them. And then he would take a separate sheet of paper. And we have to presume he didn't cheat, and he would write down as many of them as he could and he would try and keep them in the same sequence. Then he would compare to the original list and he would see how many errors he made. And he would do this over, and over, and over again. And as you would expect, early in the training and the learning it took a lot more repetitions to get the sequence correct. And over time, it took fewer sequences. And he referred to that difference in the initial number of repetitions that he had to perform versus the later number of repetitions he had to perform as a so-called savings. So he literally thought of the brain as having to generate a kind of a currency of effort. And he talked about savings as the reduction in the amount of effort that he had to put forward in order to learn information. And what he got was a learning curve. And you can imagine what that learning curve looked like. It had a very sharp peak at the beginning that dropped off over time. And of course, he remembered all this meaningless information. But even though the information might have been meaningless, the experiment itself and what Ebbinghaus demonstrated was immensely meaningful. Because what it said was that with repetition we can activate particular sequences of neurons and that repeated activation lays down what we call a memory. And that might all seem like a big duh, but prior to Ebbinghaus, none of that was known. Now, I should also say Ebbinghaus, because of when he was alive, was not aware of these things that we called neural circuits. It was in 1906 that Golgi and Cajal got the Nobel prize for actually showing that neurons are independent cells connected by synapses, these little gaps between them where they communicate. So he may have been aware of that, but the whole notion of neural circuits hadn't really come about. Nevertheless, what the Ebbinghaus learning curves really established was that sheer repetition, just repeating things over and over and over again is sufficient to learn. Something that no doubt had been observed before but had never been formally quantified. Now, if we look at that result, there's something really important that lies a little bit cryptic, that's not so obvious to most people. Which is, the information that he was trying to learn wasn't any more interesting the second time than it was the first, probably it was even less interesting and less and less interesting with each repetition. And yet it was sheer repetition that allowed him to remember. Now sometime later in the early to mid 1920s, a psychologist in Canada named Donald Hebb came up with what was called Hebb's postulate. And Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking, is this idea that if a sequence of neurons is active at the same time, or at roughly the same time, that would lead to a strengthening of a connections between those neurons. And many, many decades of experimentation later we now know that postulate to be true. Neurons themselves are not smart, they don't have knowledge. So every memory is the consequence, as I told you before, of the repeated activation of a particular chain of neurons. And what Ebbinghaus showed through repetition and what Donald Hebb proposed and was eventually verified through experimentation on animals and humans was that if you encourage the co-activation of neurons. Meaning have neurons fire at roughly the same time, they will strengthen their connections. It leads to a bias in the probability that those neurons will be active again. Now, this is vitally important because nowadays we hear a lot about how memories are the consequence of new neurons added into the brain. Or that every time you learn something, a new connection in your brain forms. Well, sorry to break it to you, but that's simply not the case. Most of the time, and I want to emphasize most, not all but most of the time when we learn something it's because existing neurons, not new neurons, but existing neurons strengthen their connections through co-activation over and over and over. Through repetition or, and this is a very important or, or through very strong activation once and only once. In fact, there's something called one trial learning whereby we experience something and we will remember that thing forever. This is often most associated with negative events, and I'll explain why in a few minutes. But it can also be associated with positive events. Like the first time you saw your romantic partner. Or something that happened with that romantic partner. Or the first time that you saw your child. Or any other positive event, as well as any other extremely negative event. So again, both repetition, and I guess we could label it intensity. But what we really mean when we say intensity is strong activation of neurons can lay down these traces, these circuits that are far more likely to be active again, than had there not been repetition or not some strong activation of those circuits. So with that in mind, let's return to the original contrarian question that I raised before. Which is, why do we remember anything? Everyday you wake up, your neurons in your brain and body are active. Different neural circuits are active. And yet, you only remember a small fraction of the things that happen each day. And yet, you retain a lot of information from previous days and the days before those and so on. It is only with a lot of repetition or with extremely strong activation of a given neural circuit that we will create new memories. And so in a few minutes I'll explain how to get extremely strong activation of particular neural circuits. Repetition is pretty obvious. Repetition is repetition. But in a few minutes I'll illustrate a whole set of experiments and a whole set of tools that point to how you can get extra strong activation of a given neural circuit as it relates to learning so that you will remember that information, perhaps not just with one trial of learning, but certainly with far fewer repetitions than would be required otherwise. Before we go any further I want to preface the discussion by saying that there are a lot of different kinds of memory. In fact, were you to take a voyage into the neuroscience, and or psychology of memory you would find an immense number of different terms to describe the immense number of different types of memory that researchers focus on. But for the sake of today's discussion, I really just want to focus on short term memory, medium term memory, and longterm memory. And while there is still debate, as is always the case with scientists, frankly, about the exact divisions between short term, medium, and longterm memory, we can broadly define short term memory and longterm memory. And we can describe a couple different types of those that I think you can relate to in your everyday life. The most common form of short term memory that we're going to focus on is called working memory. Working memory is your ability to keep a chain of numbers in mind for some period of time but the expectation really isn't that you would remember those numbers the next day and certainly not the next week. So a good example would be a phone number. If I were to tell ya a phone number, 493-2938, well you could probably remember it. 493-2938. But if I came back tomorrow and asked you to repeat that chain of numbers, most likely you would not. Unless, of course, we used a particular tool to stamp down that memory into your mind and commit it to longterm memory. Now of course, in this day in age, most people have phone numbers programmed into their phone and they don't really have to remember the exact numbers. It's usually done by contact identity and so forth. So a different example that some of you are probably more familiar with would be those security codes. So you try and log unto an app or a website and it asks you for a security code that's been sent to your text messages and you can either plug that in directly in some cases, or you have to remember that short sequence of anywhere usually from six to seven, sometimes eight numbers. Your ability to do that, to switch back and forth between web pages or apps and plug in that number by remembering the sequence and plugging it in, by texting or keying it in on your keyboard, that's a really good example of working memory. Longterm memory, of the sort that we're going to be talking a lot about today is your ability to commit certain patterns of information, either cognitive information or motor information. Right, the ability to move your limbs in a particular sequence. Over long periods of time. Such that you could remember it a day, or a week, or a month, or maybe even a year or several years later. So we've got short term memory and longterm memory. And we've got this working memory which is sort of keeping something online but then discarding okay. Not online on a computer, but online within your brain. There are also two major categories of memory that I'd like you to know about. One is explicit memory. So this is not necessarily explicit of the sort that you're used to thinking about. But rather the fact that you can declare you know something. So you have an explicit memory of your name. Presumably you have an explicit memory of the house or the apartment that you grew up in. You know something and you know you know it. And you can declare it. So I can ask you, what was the color of the first car that you owned? Or what is the color of your romantic partner's hair? These sorts of things. That's an explicit declarative memory. But you also have explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, as the name suggests, involve action sequences. The simplest one, it's almost ridiculously simple, is walking. If I say, how is it that you walk from one room to the other? You'd probably say, well, I go that direction and then I turn left. I say, no, no, no. How is it exactly that you do it? You say, well, I move my left foot, then my right foot, then my left foot. And you could describe that. So it's an explicit procedural memory. So much so that if you were going to teach a young toddler how to walk, you would probably say okay, good, good, try. Okay, then you know, probably that's going to be pre-language for the toddler. But you're going to encourage them to move one leg then the other. And you're going to encourage and reward them for moving one leg then the other. Because you have an explicit procedural memory of how to walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly ridiculously simple, but nonetheless, when you think about it in the context of neural circuits and neural firing, pretty amazing. Even more amazing is the fact that all explicit memories, both declarative and procedural explicit memories can be moved from explicit to implicit. What do I mean by that? Well, in the example of walking you might have chuckled a little bit or kind of shook your head and said, this is a ridiculous thing to ask. How do I walk from one room to the next? I just walk. I just do it. Ah, well, what is just do it? What it is, is that you have an implicit understanding. Meaning your nervous system knows how to walk without you actually having to think about what you know about how to walk. You just get up out of your chair or you get up out of bed and you walk. In the brain you have a structure. In fact, you have one on each side of your brain. It's called the hippocampus. The hippocampus literally means seahorse. Anatomists like to name brain structures after things that they think those brain structures resemble. When I look at the hippocampus, frankly, it doesn't look like a seahorse. Which either reflects my lack of understanding of what a seahorse really looks like, a visual deficit, or I think it's fair to say that those anatomists were using a little bit of creative elaboration when thinking about what the hippocampus looks like. Nonetheless, it is a curved structure. It has many layers. It's been described by my colleague Robert Sapolsky and by others as looking more like a jelly roll or a cinnamon roll, is what it looks like to me. And if you were to take one cinnamon roll, chop it down the middle. So now you've got two half cinnamon rolls and rather than put them back together in the configuration they were before, you just slide one down so that you've got essentially two C's. Two C-shaped halves of this cinnamon roll and you push them together, right, slightly off set from one another. Well, that's what the hippocampus looks like to me. And I think that's a far better description of its actual physical structure. But I guess if you were to use that physical structure as the name, well then you'd have to open up a brain atlas and it would be called two half-C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together. So that's not very good. So I guess, seahorse will work. Hippocampus is the name of this structure and it is the site in your brain, and again, you have one on each side of your brain, in which explicit declarative memories are formed. It is not where those memories are stored and maintained. It is where they are established in the first place. In contrast, implicit memories, the subconscious memories, are formed and stored elsewhere in the brain. Mainly by areas like the cerebellum, but also the neocortex, the kind of outer shell of your brain. The cerebellum literally means mini-brain. And it does in fact look like a mini-brain. And is in the back of the brain. And the neocortex is the outer part of the brain that covers all the other stuff. So, the hippocampus is vitally important for establishing these new, declarative memories of what you know and what you know how to do. Now, in order to really understand the role of the hippocampus in memory, in particular explicit declarative, and explicit procedural memory and to really understand how that's distinct from implicit declarative and implicit procedural memories we have to look to a clinical case. And the clinical case that I'm referring to is a patient who went by the name HM. Patient's go by their initials in order to maintain confidentiality of their real identity. HM had what's called intractable epilepsy. So he would have these really dramatic, so-called grand mal seizures, or drop seizures. For those of you that know somebody with epilepsy, or that have epilepsy, you might be familiar with this. You can have petite mal seizures, which are minor seizures. You can have tonic clonic seizures, which are sometimes not even detectable. You can have absent seizures where people will just stop, it's almost as if their brain kind of goes on pause and they'll just stop there. It was reported actually that Einstein had absent seizures. Although I don't know that's ever really been confirmed neurologically. Grand mal seizures are extremely severe and that's what HM had. So he could just be going about his day and maybe even cooking, or doing something, driving, operating any kind of machinery, and then all of a sudden he would just have a drop seizure. So he would just physically drop and go into a grand mal seizure. So convulsing of the whole body, loss of consciousness, etc. Or he would feel it coming on. Often times people with epilepsy can feel the epileptic seizure coming on. Kind of like a wave from the back of the brain. And sometimes they can get to a safe circumstance, but not always. And so the frequency and the intensity of his seizures were so robust that the neurosurgeons and neurologists decided that they needed to locate the origin, what they call the foci of those seizures, and remove that brain tissue. Because the way seizures work is they spread out from that focus, or that foci of brain tissue. And unfortunately for HM, the focus of his seizures was the hippocampus. So after a lot of deliberation, a neurosurgeon, in fact one of the most famous neurosurgeons in the world at that time, made what are called electrolytic lesions, actually burned out the hippocampus in the brain of HM. And as a consequence, he lost all explicit memory. Now the consequence of this was that he couldn't exist in normal, everyday life, like most people. So he had to live mostly, not entirely, but mostly in a kind of hospital setting. And I've talked to several people, who have I should say, who met HM directly, because he's no longer alive. But an interaction with him might look like the following. He would walk up to you just fine. You wouldn't know that he had any kind of brain damage. He could walk fine, he could speak fine. And you'd say, hi, I'm Andrew. And he'd say, hi, I'm whatever his name happened to be. He wouldn't say HM, but he'd probably say his real name. And then perhaps someone new would walk into the room. He might turn around, look at that person, as any of us might do. Then turn around back to me and say, hi, what's your name? And if I were to say, well, I just told you my name. And you just told me your name, do you remember that? And he'd say, I'm sorry, I don't remember any of that. What's your name? So you'd go through this over and over again. So a complete lack of explicit declarative memory. Now he did have some memory for previous events in his life that dated way back, okay. Again, hinting at the idea that memories are not necessarily stored in the hippocampus, they're just formed in the hippocampus. So once they've moved out of the hippocampus to other brain areas, he could still keep those memories. They're in a different database, if you will. They're in a different pattern of firing of other neural circuits. But he couldn't form new memories. Now there's some very important and interesting twists on what HM could and could not do in terms of learning and memory that teach us a lot about the brain. In fact, I think most neuroscientists would agree that this unfortunate case of HM's epilepsy and the subsequent neuro surgery that he had taught us much of what we know, or at least think about, in terms of human learning and memory. For instance, as I mentioned before, he still had implicit knowledge. He knew how to walk. He knew how to do certain things like make a cup of coffee. He knew the names of people that he had met much earlier in his life, and so on. And yet he couldn't form new memories. Now, in violation to that last statement, there were some elements of HM's emotionality that suggests that there was some sort of residual capacity to learn new information but it wasn't what we normally think of as explicit declarative or procedural memory. For instance, it's been reported or it's been said, I should say, because I don't know that the studies were ever done with intense physiological measurements, that if you were to tell HM a joke, and he thought it was funny, he would laugh really hard. He liked jokes, so you'd say hey, HM, I want to tell you a joke. You tell him a joke and he'd laugh really hard. Then you could leave the room, come back, and tell him the same joke again. Now keep in mind, he did not remember that you told him the joke previously. And the second time he would laugh a little bit less. And then you'd leave the room, come back again. Say hi, I'm Andrew. And he'd say, oh, nice to meet you. Because as you know, as you recall, because you can recall things. But he couldn't recall things. He didn't know that he just met you. Or at least he couldn't remember it. You tell him the joke a third time, or a fourth time, and with each subsequent telling of the joke he found it a little less funny. Just as, keep this in mind, folks, if you tell a joke and you get a big laugh, don't tell it again. At least not immediately. Not to the same person or the same crowd because the second time it's a little less funny and the third time it's a little less funny. And that actually has to do with a whole element of dopamine and it's relationship to surprise. And that's the topic of a future podcast where we talk all about humor and novelty in the brain. But the point being that certain forms of memory seem to exist in a kind of phantom like way within HM's brain. What do I mean by that? Well, this underscores that he had an implicit memory of having heard the joke before. And it suggests that humor, or at least what we find funny, is somehow more related to procedures. Similar to walking or a motor ability than it is to this precise content of that joke. All right, that's a little bit of an abstract concept, but the point is that HM lacked explicit declarative memory. He couldn't tell you what he had just heard. He could not learn new information. And he couldn't tell you how to do something unless he had learned how to do that something many years prior. Now, there have been a lot of other patients besides HM that have had brain lesions due to epilepsy, or I should say due to surgeries to treat epilepsy, due to strokes, due to sadly gunshot wounds and other forms of what we call infarcts, infarct. I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct is the word we use to describe damage to a particular brain region. And many different patients with many different patterns of infarct have taught us a lot about how memory and other aspects of the brain work. HM really teaches us that what we know and what we are able to do is the consequence of things that we are aware of and learnings that have been passed off into subconscious knowledge, that our body knows. Our brain knows, but we don't know exactly how we know that thing. And I tell you the story about HM's ability to understand a joke, but that with repeated telling of the joke it has less and less and less of an impact in creating a sense of laughter, of humor in HM. Not as just an anecdote to flesh out his story, but because emotion itself turns out to be the way in which we can enhance memories even if those are memories for things that are not funny, are not intensely sad, are not immensely happy or don't evoke a really strong emotional response, or even any emotional response. And the reason for that is that emotions, just like perception, just like sensation, are the consequence of particular neuro chemicals being present in our brain and body. And as I'm going to tell you next, there are particular neuro chemicals that you can leverage in order to learn specific information faster and to remember it for a much longer period of time, maybe even forever. And you can do that by leveraging the relationship in your nervous system between your brain and your body. And your body back to your brain. So let's talk about tools for enhancing memory. Now there's one tool that it's absolutely clear works. And it's always worked, it works now, and it will work forever. And that's repetition. The more often that you perform something or that you recite something, the more likely you are to remember it in the future. And while that might seem obvious, it's worth thinking about what's happening when you repeat something. But when I say what's happening, I mean at the neural level. What's happening is that you're encouraging the firing of particular chains of neurons that reside in a particular circuit, right. So a particular sequence of neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D played in that particular sequence over and over and over again. And with more repetitions, you get more strengthening of those nerve connections. Now, repetition works but the problem for most people is they either don't have the patience, they don't have the time, and sometimes they literally don't have the time because they've got a deadline on something that they're trying to remember and learn. Or they simply would like to be able to remember things better in general and remember them more quickly. This process of accelerating repetition based learning so that your learning curve doesn't go from having to perform something 1,000 times and then gradually over time it's 1,000, 750 times a day, 500 times a day, 300 times a day, and down to no repetitions, right? You can just perform that thing the first time and every time. Well, there is a way to shift that curve so that you can essentially establish stronger connections between the neurons that are involved in generating that memory or behavior more quickly. How do you do that? Well, in order to answer that we have to look at the beautiful work of James McGaugh and Larry Cahill. James McGaugh and Larry Cahill did a number experiments over several decades really based on a lot of animal literature, but mainly focused on humans that really established what's required to get better at remembering things and to do so very quickly. I want to talk about one experiment that they did that was particularly important. And we will provide a link to this paper, it's some years old now, but the results still hold up. In fact, the results established an entire field of memory and neuroscience and psychology. What they did is they had human subjects come into the laboratory and to read a short paragraph of about 12 sentences. And the key thing is that some subjects read a paragraph that was pretty mundane. The content, the information within the paragraph was all related to the content of the previous sentence. So it was a cogent paragraph. Right, it just wasn't a meaningless scramble of words. But it described a kind of mundane set of circumstances. Maybe it would be a story about someone who walked into a room, sat down at a desk, wrote for a little bit, then got up and had lunch. You know, just kind of mundane information. Not very interesting. Another group of subjects read also a 12 sentence paragraph. But that paragraph included a subset of sentences that had a lot of emotionally intense language. Or that had language that could evoke an emotionally intense response in the person reading it. So it might have talked about a car accident or a very intense surgery. But it also could be positive stuff. Things like a birthday party, or a celebration of some other kind. Or a big sports win. So in other words, you have two conditions of this study. People either read a boring paragraph, or they read a really emotionally laden paragraph. And again, the emotions could either be positive or negative emotions. Subjects left the laboratory and sometime later they were called back to the laboratory and I should say, at no point in the experiment did they know they were part of a memory experiment. Okay, they don't even know why they were reading this paragraph. They came in either for class credit or to get paid. That's typically how these things are done on college campuses or elsewhere. They come back into the lab and they would get a pop quiz. They would be asked to recall the content of the paragraph that they had read previously. Now as is probably expected, perhaps even obvious to you, the subjects that read the emotionally intense paragraph remembered far more of the content of that paragraph and were far more accurate in their remembering of that information. Now, that particular finding wasn't very novel. Many people had previously described how emotionally intense events are better remembered than non-emotionally intense events. In fact, way back in the 1600s Francis Bacon, who's largely credited with developing the scientific method, said, quote, memory is assisted by anything that makes an impression on a powerful passion. Inspiring fear, for example, or wonder, shame, or joy. Francis Bacon said that in 1620. So Jim McGaugh and Larry Cahill were certainly not the first to demonstrate or to conceive of the idea that emotionally laden experiences are more easily remembered than other experiences. However, what they did next was immensely important for our understanding of memory and for our building of tools to enhance learning and memory. What they did was they evaluated the capacity for stress and for particular neuro chemicals associated with stress to improve our ability to learn information. Not just information that is emotional, but information of all kinds. So I'm going to describe some experiments done in animal models just very briefly, and then experiments done on humans subjects. Because McGaugh worked mainly on animals, also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively on human subjects. If you take a rat or a mouse and put it in an arena where at one location the animal receives an electrical shock and then you come back the next day, you remove the shock evoking device and you let the animal move around that arena, that animal will, quite understandably, avoid the location where it was shocked. So called conditioned place aversion. That affect of avoiding that particular location occurs in one trial. That's a good example of one trial learning. So somehow the animal knows that it was shocked at that location, it remembers that. It is a hippocampal dependent learning. So animals that lack a hippocampus or who have their hippocampus pharmacologically or otherwise incapacitated, will not learn that new bit of information. But for animals that do, they remember it after the first time and every time. Unless, you are to block the release of certain chemicals in the brain and body and the chemicals I'm referring to are epinephrine, adrenaline, and to some extent the corticosterones. Things like cortisol. Now we know that the effect of getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine, at least in this particular experimental scenario. Because if researchers do the exact same experiment, and they have done the exact same experiment, but they introduce a pharmacological blocker of epinephrine, so that epinephrine is released in response to the shock, but it cannot actually bind to its receptors and have all its biological effects, well then the animal is perfectly happy to tread back into the area where it received the shock. It's almost as if it didn't know, or we have to assume, it didn't remember that it received the shock at that location. So it all seems pretty obvious when you hear it. Something bad happens in a location, you don't go back to that location. So that's condition place avoidance. But it turns out that the opposite is also true. Meaning for something called condition place preference you can take an animal, put it into an arena, feed it or reward it some how at one location in that arena. So you can give a hungry rat or mouse food at one particular location, take the animal out, come back the next day. No food is introduced, but it will go back to the location where it received the food. Or you can do any variant of this. You can make the arena a little bit chilly and provide warmth at that location. Or you can take a male animal. And it turns out male rats and mice will mate at any point. Or a female animal that's at the particular so called receptive phase of her mating cycle and give them an opportunity to mate at a give location, they'll go back to that location and wait away. This is perhaps why people go back to the same bar, or the seat at the bar, or the same restaurant and wait because of the one time they, you know, things worked out for them. Whatever the context was. Condition place preference. Condition place preference as with condition place avoidance depends on the release of adrenaline, right. It's not just about stress. It's about a heightened emotional state in the brain and body. Okay, this is really important. It's not just about stress. You can get one trial learning for positive events, condition place preference. And you can get one trial learning for negative events. Here I say positive and negative, I'm putting what's called valence on it. Making a value judgment about whether not the animal liked it or didn't like it. And we have to presume what the animal liked or didn't like and how it felt. But this turns out all to be true for humans as well. We know that because McGaugh and Cahill did experiments where they gave people a boring paragraph to read and only a boring paragraph to read. But one group of subjects was asked to read the paragraph and then to place their arm into very, very cold water. In fact, it was ice water. We know that placing one's arm into ice water, especially if it's up to the shoulder or near to it, evokes the release of adrenaline in the body. It's not an enormous release, but it's a significant increase. And yes, they measured adrenaline release. In some cases they also measured for things like cortisol, etc. And what they found is that if one evokes the release of adrenaline through this arm into ice water approach, the information that they read previously, just a few minutes before, was remembered, it was retained as well as emotionally intense information. But keep in mind the information that they read was not interesting at all. Or at least, it wasn't emotionally laden. This had to be the effect of adrenaline released into the brain and body, because if they blocked the release or the function of adrenaline in the brain and or body, they could block this effect. Now the biology of epinephrine and cortisol are a little bit complex, but there's some nuance there that's actually interesting and important to us. First of all, adrenaline is released in the body and in the brain. It's released in the body from the adrenals. Remember, epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing. Cortisol is also released from the adrenal glands. These two little glands that ride atop our kidneys. But it can't cross into the brain. It only has what we call peripheral effects. Quickening of the heart rate, right? Changes the patterns of blood flow. Changes our patterns of breathing. In general, makes our breathing more shallow and faster. In general makes our heart beat more quickly, etc. Within our brain we have a little brain area called locus coeruleus, which is in the back of the brain. Which has the opportunity to sprinkler the rest of the brain with the neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline, as well as norepinephrine, a related neuromodulator. And to essentially wake up or create a state of alertness throughout the brain. So it's a very general effect. The reason we have two sites of release is because these neuro chemicals do not cross the blood-brain barrier. And so waking up the body with adrenaline and waking up the brain are two separate, so-called parallel phenomena. Cortisol can cross the blood-brain barrier because it's lipophilic. Meaning it can move through fatty tissue. And we'll get into the biology of that in another episode. But cortisol in general is released and has much longer term effects. And as I just told you, can permeate throughout the brain and body. Adrenaline has more local effects. Or at least is segregated between the brain and the body. This will turn out to be important later. The important thing to keep in mind is that it is the emotionality evoked by an experience, or to be more precise, it is the emotional state that you are in after you experience something that dictates whether or not you will learn it quickly or not. This is absolutely important in terms of thinking about tools to improve your memory. And no, I am not going to suggest that every time you want to learn something you plunge your arm into ice water. Why won't I suggest that? Well, it will induce the release of adrenaline, but there are better ways to get that adrenaline release. Before I explain exactly what those tools are, I want to tamp down on the biology of how all this works. Because in that understanding you will have access to the best possible tools to improve your memory. First of all, McGaugh and Cahill were excellent experimentalists. They did not just establish that you could quicken the formation of a memory by accessing material that was very emotionally laden or creating an emotional, high adrenaline state after interacting with some thing. Some word, some person, some information. They also tested whether or not that whole effect could be blocked by blocking the emotional state or by blocking adrenaline. So what they did is they had people read paragraphs that either had a lot of emotional content or they had people read paragraphs that were pretty boring, but then had them put their arm into ice water. And I should say they did other experiments too to increase adrenaline. There were even some shock experiments that were done by other groups. Any number of things to evoke the release of adrenaline. Even people taking drugs that increase adrenaline. But then they also did what are called blocking experiments. They did experiments where they had people get into a highly emotional state from reading highly emotional material, or they got people to get into a highly emotional neuro chemical state by reading boring material and then taking a drug to increase adrenaline, or an ice bath, or a shock. And then they also administered a drug called a beta blocker to block the affect of adrenaline and related chemicals in the brain and body. And what they found is that even if people were exposed to something really emotional or had a lot of adrenaline in their system because they received a drug to increase the amount of adrenaline. Two manipulations that normally would increase memory, keep that in mind. If they gave them a beta blocker, which reduced the response to that adrenaline, right? So no quickening of the heart rate. No quickening of the breathing. No increase in the activity of locus coeruleus and these kind of wake up signals to the rest of the brain. Well then, the material wasn't remembered better at all. What this tells us is that, yes, Francis Bacon was right. McGaugh and Cahill were right. Hundreds, if not thousands of philosophers, and psychologists, and neuroscientists were right. In stating and in thinking that high emotional states help you learn things. But what McGaugh and Cahill really showed, and what's most important to know, is that it is the presence of high adrenaline, high amounts of norepinephrine and epinephrine and perhaps cortisol as well, as you'll soon see, that allows a memory to be stamped down quickly. It is not the emotion. It is the neuro chemical state that you go into as a consequence of the emotion. And it's very important to understand that while those two things are related, they are not one and the same thing. Because what that means is that were you to evoke the release of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol or even just one or two of those chemicals after experiencing something, you are stamping down the experience that you just previously had. Now this is fundamentally important and far and away different than the idea that we remember things because they're important to us, or because they evoke emotion. That's true, but the real reason, the neuro chemical reason, the mechanism behind all that is these neuro chemicals have the ability to strengthen neural connections by making them active just once. There's something truly magic about that neuro chemical cocktail that removes the need for repetition. Okay, so let's apply this knowledge. Let's establish a scientifically grounded set of tools. Meaning tools that take into account the identity of the neuro chemicals that are important for enhancing learning and the timing of the release of those chemicals in order to enhance learning. When I first learned about the results of McGaugh and Cahill, I was just blown away. I was also pretty upset, but not with them, I was upset with myself. Because I realized that the way that I had been approaching learning and memory was not optimal. In fact, it was probably in the opposite direction to the enhanced protocol for learning and memory that I'm going to teach you today. My typical mode of trying to learn something while I was in college, or while I was in graduate school, or as a junior professor, or a tenured professor was to sit down to whatever it is I was going to try and learn, and perhaps even memorize. Or if it was a physical skill, move to whatever environment I was going to learn that physical skill in, and prior to that, to make sure that I was hydrated, because that's important to me. And certainly can contribute to your brain's ability to function and your body's ability to function. And general patterns of alertness. But also, to caffeinate. I would have a nice, strong cup of coffee or espresso. I would have a nice strong cup of yerba mate. And I still drink coffee or yerba mate very regularly. I drink them in moderation, I think. Certainly for me. But typically I would drink those things before I would engage in any kind of attempt to learn or memorize. Or to acquire a new skill. Now caffeine in the form of coffee or yerba mate or any other form of caffeine does create a sense of alertness in our brain and body and it does that through two major mechanisms. The first mechanism is by blocking the effects of adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body the longer that we are awake. And it's largely what's responsible for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue when we've been awake for a very long time. Caffeine essentially acts to block the effects of adenosine. It's a competing agonist, not to get technical, but it binds to the receptor for adenosine for some period of time and prevents adenosine from having its normal pattern of action. And thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue. But it also increases state of alertness. So while it's reducing fatigue, it's also pushing on neuro chemical systems in order to directly increase our alertness. And it does that in large part by increasing the transmission of epinephrine, adrenaline, in the brain and body. It also has this interesting effect of up regulating the number and or efficiency, or we say the efficacy, of dopamine receptors. Such that when dopamine is present, and is a molecule that increases motivation, and craving, and pursuit, that dopamine can have a more potent effect than it would otherwise. So caffeine really hits these three systems. It hits other systems too, but it mainly reduces fatigue by reducing adenosine, increases alertness by increasing epinephrine release, or adrenaline release I should say, both from the adrenals in your body and form locus coeruleus from within the brain. And it can, in parallel to all that, increase the action or the efficacy of the action of dopamine. So my typical way of approaching learning and memory would be to drink some caffeine and then focus really hard on whatever it is that I'm trying to learn. Try and eliminate distractions and then hope, hope, hope. Or try, try, try to remember that information as best as I could. And frankly, I felt like it was working pretty well for me. And typically, if I leveraged other forms of pharmacology in order to enhance learning and memory, things like Alpha GPC, or phosphatidyl serine, I would do that by taking those things before I sat down to learn a particular set of information. Or before I went off to learn a particular physical skill. Now, for those of you out there listening to this you're probably thinking, well, okay. The results of McGaugh and Cahill pointed to the fact that having adrenaline released after learning something enhanced learning of that thing. But a lot of these things like caffeine, or Alpha GPC can increase epinephrine and adrenaline or dopamine or other molecules in the brain and body that can enhance memory for a long period of time. So it makes sense to take it first, or even during learning, and then allow that increase to occur. And the increase will occur over a long period of time and will enhance learning and memory. And while that is partially true, it is not entirely true. And it turns out it's not optimal. Work that was done by the McGaugh laboratory, and in other laboratories evaluated the precise temporal relationship between neuro chemical activation of these pathways and learning and memory. What they did is they had animals and or people, depending on the experiment, take a drug. It could be caffeine. It could be in pill form. Something that would increase adrenaline or related molecules that create this state of alertness that are related to emotionality. And they had them do it either an hour before, 30 minutes before, 10 minutes before, or five minutes before learning, or during the about of learning, right? The reading of the information or the performing of the skill that one is trying to learn. Or five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc. afterwards. So they looked very precisely at when exactly is best to evoke this adrenaline release. And it turns out that the best time window to evoke the release of these chemicals, if the goal is to enhance learning and memory of the material is either immediately after or just a few minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes after you're repeating that information. You're trying to learn that information. Again, this could be cognitive information or this could be a physical skill. Now this really spits in the face of the way that most of us approach learning and memory. Most of us, if we use stimulants like caffeine or Alpha GPC, we're taking those before or during an attempt to learn, not afterwards. These results point to the fact that it is after the learning and memory that you really want to get that big increase in epinephrine and the related molecules that will tamp down memory. So what this means is that if you are currently using caffeine or other compounds, and we'll talk about what those are and safety issues and so forth in a moment. If you're using those compounds in order to enhance learning and memory by taking them before or during a learning episode, well then I encourage you to try and take them either late in the learning episode or immediately after the learning episode. Now given everything I've told you up until now why would I say late in the learning episode or immediately after? Well, when you ingest something by drinking it or you take it in capsule form, there's a period of time before that gets absorbed into the body. And different substances, such as caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc are absorbed from the gut and into the blood stream and reach the brain and trigger these affects in the brain and body at different rates. So it's not instantaneous. Some have effects within minutes, others within tens of minutes and so on. It's really going to depend on the pharmacology of those things and it's also going to depend on whether or not you have food in your gut, what else you happen to have circulating in your blood stream, etc. But at a very basic level we can confidently say that there are not one, not dozens, but as I mentioned before, hundreds of studies in animals and in humans that point to the fact that triggering the increase of adrenaline late in learning or immediately after learning is going to be most beneficial if your goal is to retain that information for some period of time. And to reduce the number of repetitions required in order to learn that information. Now, I want to acknowledge that on previous episodes of this podcast and in appearing on other podcasts, I've talked a lot about things like non-sleep deep rest, and naps, and sleep as vital to the learning process. And I want to emphasize that none of that information has changed. I don't look at any of that information differently as the consequence of what I'm talking about today. It is still true that the strengthening of connections in the brain, the literal neural plasticity, the changing of the circuits occurs during deep sleep and non-sleep deep rest. And it is also true, and I've mentioned these results earlier that two papers were published in Cell Reports, Cell Press journal, excellent journal over the last few years showing that brief naps of about 20 up to 90 minutes in some period of time after an attempt to learn can enhance the rate of learning and memory. However, those bouts of sleep, the deep sleep that night, I should say, or those brief naps, or even the so-called NSDR as we call it, non-sleep deep rest that was used to enhance the learning and memory of particular pieces of information. Either cognitive or physical information or both. That still can be performed, but it can be performed some hours later, even an hour later. It can be performed two hours later or four hours later. Remember, it's in these naps and in deep sleep that the actual reconfiguration of the neural circuits occurs, the strengthening of those neural circuits occurs. It is not the case that you need to finish a about of learning and drop immediately into a nap or sleep. Some people might do that, but if you're really trying to optimize and enhance and improve your memory, the data from McGaugh and Cahill and many other laboratories that stemmed out from their initial work really point to the fact that the ideal protocol would be focus on the thing you're trying to learn very intensely. There are also some other things like error rates, etc. Please see our episodes on learning. We have a newsletter on how to learn better. You can access that at HubermanLab.com. It's a zero cost newsletter. You can grab that PDF. It lists out the things to do during the learning about. Still try and get excellent sleep. Again, fundamentally important for mental health, physical health, and performance. And we can now extend from performance to saying including learning and memory. Nap if it doesn't interrupt your nighttime sleep. Naps of anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes. Or non-sleep deep rest protocols will enhance learning and memory, but we can now add to that, that spiking adrenaline provided it can be done in a safe way, is going to reduce the number of repetitions required to learn. And that should be done at the very tail end or immediately after a learning about. Which is compatible with all the other protocols that I mentioned. And the reason I'm revisiting this stuff about sleep and non-sleep deep rest is I think that some people got the impression that they need to do that immediately after learning and today I'm saying to the contrary. Immediately after learning you need to go into a heightened state of emotionality and alertness. Now it's vitally important to point out that you do not need pharmacology. You don't need caffeine. You don't need Alpha GPC. You don't need any pharmacologic substance to spike adrenaline unless that's something that you already are doing. Or that you can do safely. Or that you know you can do safely. And I always say, and I'll say it again, I'm not a physician so I'm not prescribing anything. I'm a professor, so I profess things. You need to what's safe for you. So if you're somebody who's not used to drinking caffeine and you suddenly drink four espresso after trying to learn something, you are going to have a severe increase in alertness and probably even anxiety. If you're panic attack prone, please don't start taking stimulants in order to learn things better. Please be safe. I don't just say that to protect me, I say that to protect you. And I should mention that if you're not accustomed to taking something, you always want to first check with your doctor, of course, but also move into that gradually, right? Start with the lowest effective dose. The minimal effective dose. And sometimes the minimal effective dose is zero milligrams, it's nothing. Why do I say that? Well, we already talked about results where they put people's arms into an ice bath in order to evoke adrenaline release. You are welcome to do that if you want. In fact, that's a pretty low cost, zero pharmacology. At least exogenous pharmacology way to approach this whole thing. That's a way of evoking your own natural epinephrine that turns out also dopamine release. You could take a cold shower. You could do an ice bath or get into a cold circulating bath. We've done several episodes on the utility of cold for health and performance. You can find those episodes at HubermanLab.com. Also the episode with my colleague at Stanford from the biology department, Dr. Craig Heller. Lots of protocols, in particular in the episode on cold for health and performance. That describe how best to use the cold shower or the ice bath or the circulating cold bath in order to evoke epinephrine and dopamine release. The point is that the time in which you would want to do those protocols is after, ideally immediately after your learning about. Meaning when you're sitting down to learn new information or after trying to learn some new physical skill. Now whether or not that's compatible with the other reasons you're doing deliberate cold exposure, and whether or not that's compatible with the other things you're doing, that depends on the contour of your lifestyle, your training, your academic goals, your learning goals, etc. But if your specific purpose is to enhance learning and memory, you want to spike adrenaline afterwards. And so what I'm telling you is you can do that with caffeine. You can do that with Alpha GPC. You can do that with a combination of caffeine and Alpha GPC. If you can do that safely. Some of you I know are using other forms of pharmacology. I did a long episode all about ADHD. I have to just really declare my stance very clearly that I am not a fan, I am actually opposed to people using prescription drugs who are not prescribed those drugs in order to enhance alertness. I think there's a big addictive potential. There also is a potential to really disrupt one's own pharmacology around the dopaminergic system. However, some of you I know are prescribed things like ritalin, Adderall and modafinil and things of that sort in order to increase alertness and focus. So for those of you that are prescribed those things from a board certified physician, you're going to have to decide if you're going to take them before trying to learn or after trying to learn. You also have to take into consideration that some of those drugs are very long acting. Some are shorter acting. And time that according to what you're trying to learn and when. So that's pharmacology. But as I mentioned, there are the behavioral protocols. You can use cold and cold is an excellent stimulus because first of all, it doesn't involve pharmacology. Second of all, you can generally access it at low to zero cost, especially the cold shower approach. And third, you can titrate it. You can start with warmer water. You can make it very, very cold if that's your thing and you're able to tolerate that safely. You can make it moderately cold. How cold should it be in order to invoke adrenaline release? Well, it should be uncomfortably cold but cold enough that you feel like you really want to get out, but can stay in safely. That's going to evoke adrenaline release. If it quickens your breathing, if it makes you go wide eyed. That's increasing adrenaline release. In fact, those effects of going wide eyed and quickening of the breathing and the challenges in thinking clearly, those are the direct effects of adrenaline on your brain and body. And of course, there are other ways to increase adrenaline. You could go out for a hard run. You could do any number of things that would increase adrenaline in your body. Which things you choose is up to you, but from a very clear, solid grounding in research data, we can confidently say that spiking adrenaline after interacting with some material, physical or cognitive material that you're trying to learn, is going to be the best time to spike that adrenaline. Now I realize I'm being a bit redundant today or perhaps a lot redundant. In repeating over and over that the increase in epinephrine should occur either very late in an attempt to learn something or immediately after an attempt to learn something. I also want to emphasize the general contour of pharmacologic effects and of behavioral tools to create adrenaline. What do I mean by that sentence? What I mean is that McGaugh and colleagues explored a huge number of different compounds and approaches. Everything from the hand into the ice bath to injecting adrenaline, to caffeine, to drugs that block the affects of adrenaline and caffeine. Drugs like muscimol and picrotoxin. Please don't take those. These are drugs that reduce or enhance the amount of adrenaline and the overall takeaway is that anything that increases adrenaline will increase learning and memory and will reduce the number of repetitions required to learn something. Regardless of whether or not that something has an emotional intensity or not. Provided that spike in adrenaline occurs late in the learning or immediately after. And anything that reduces epinephrine and adrenaline will impair learning. And that's the key and novel piece of information that I'm adding now. Which is if you're taking beta blockers, for instance. Or if you're trying to learn something and it's not evoking much of an emotional response, and you're not using any pharmacology or other methods to enhance adrenaline release after learning that thing, well, you're not going to learn it very well. In fact, McGaugh and Cahill did beautiful experiments in humans looking at how much adrenaline is increased by varying the emotional intensity of different things that they were trying to get people to learn. Or by changing the dosage of epinephrine. Or by changing the amount of epinephrine blocker that they injected. Lots and lots of studies. The key thing to take away from those studies is that for some people, adrenaline was increased 600 to 700%. So six to seven fold over baseline in the amount of circulating epinephrine or adrenaline. And keep in mind, sometimes that increase was due to the actual thing they were trying to learn being very emotional, positive or negative emotion. And sometimes it was because they were using a pharmacologic approach or the ice bath approach. I don't think they ever used a cold shower approach, but that would have been a very effective one we can be sure. However, other people had a zero to 10% increase. So a very small increase in epinephrine. What we can confidently say on the basis of all those data is that the more epinephrine release, the better that people remembered the material. Over and over again this was shown. Whether or not it was for cognitive material, so learning a language, learning a passage of words, learning mathematics. Or whether or not it was for physical learning. I want to emphasize something about physical learning because I know a number of you are probably drinking a cup of coffee or having a cup of yerba mate or maybe even an energy drink and taking some Alpha GPC or something before physical exercise. I'm not saying that's a bad thing to do or you wouldn't want to do that. But that's really to increase alertness. It won't enhance learning, at least not as well as doing those things after the physical exercise. Now again, many of you, including myself, exercise for the sake of the physical benefits of that exercise. So cardiovascular, resistance training. But we're not really focused on learning and memory. So, I emphasize this just so it's immensely clear to everybody. If you want to use those approaches of increasing adrenaline prior to or during physical training, or cognitive work for that matter, be my guest. I think that's perfectly fine, provided that's safe for you. It's only by moving it to late or after the learning that you're really shifting the role of that adrenaline increase to enhancing memory specifically. And as a cautionary note, don't think that you can push this entire system to the extreme over and over again, or chronically, as we say, and get away with it. In other words, you're not going to be able to take a Alpha GPC and a double espresso do your focus about of work, cognitive or physical work, and then spike adrenaline again afterwards and remember that stuff you did better, right. I'm not encouraging you, in fact I'm discouraging you from chronically increasing adrenaline both during and after a given about of work if the goal is to learn. Why do I say that? Well, work from McGaugh and Cahill and others has shown that it's not the absolute amount of adrenaline that you release in your brain and body that matters for enhancing memory. It's the amount of adrenaline you release relative to the amount of adrenaline that was in your system just prior. Particularly in the hour or two prior. So again, it's the delta, as we say. It's the difference. So if you're going to chronically increase adrenaline you're not going to learn as well. The real key is to have adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just as much as you need in order to be able to focus on something, pay attention to it, and then spike it afterwards. This is immensely important because while much of what we're talking about is actually a form of inducing a neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning a brief and rapid onset of stress. Well, chronic stress, the chronic elevation of epinephrine and cortisol is actually detrimental to learning. And there's an entire category of literature mainly from the work of the great and sadly the late Bruce McEwen from the Rockefeller University. And some of his scientific offspring like the great Robert Sapolsky, showing that chronic stress, chronic elevation of epinephrine actually inhibits learning and memory. And also can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases in adrenaline and cortisol actually can enhance learning and indeed, can enhance the immune system. So if you really want to leverage this information, you might consider getting your brain and body into a very calm and yet alert state. So a high attentional state that will allow you to focus on what it is that you're trying to learn. We know focus is vital for encoding information and for triggering neuroplasticity. But remaining calm throughout that time and then afterwards spiking adrenaline and allowing adrenaline to have these incredible effects on reducing the number of repetitions required to learn. So if you're like me, you're learning about this information this beautiful work of McGaugh and Cahill and others and thinking, wow, I should perhaps consider spiking my adrenaline in one form or another at the tail end or immediately following an attempt to learn something. And yet, we are not the first to have this conversation. Nor were McGaugh and Cahill or any other researchers that I've discussed today the first to start using this technique. In fact, there is a beautiful review that was published just this year, May of 2022 in the journal Neuron, Cell Press Journal. Excellent journal. Called Mechanisms of Memory Under Stress. And I just want to read to you the first opening paragraph of this review, which is, as the name suggests, all about memory and stress. So here I'm reading, and I quote, \"In Medieval times communities threw\" \"young children in the river when\" \"they wanted them to remember important events.\" \"They believed that throwing a child in the water\" \"after witnessing historic proceedings\" \"would leave a life long memory\" \"for the events in the child.\" Believe it or not, this is true. This is a practice that somehow people arrived at. I don't know if they were aware of what adrenaline was. Probably not. But somehow in medieval times it was understood that spiking adrenaline or creating a robust emotional experience after an experience that one hoped a child would learn would encourage the child's nervous system, they didn't even know what a nervous system was, but would encourage the brain and body of that child to remember those particular events. Very counter intuitive if you ask me. I would have thought that the kid would remember only being thrown into the river. My guess is that they remember that, but the idea here anyway, is they also remember the things that preceded being thrown into the river. So both interesting and amusing and somewhat, I should say thought stimulating, really. That this is a practice that has been going on for many hundreds of years. And we are not the first to start thinking about using cold water as an adrenaline stimulus. Nor are we the first to start thinking about using cold water induced adrenaline as a way to enhance learning and memory. This has been happening since medieval times. So up until now I've been talking about pretty broad contour of these experiments. I've been talking about the underlying pharmacology, the role of epinephrine and so forth. I haven't really talked a lot about the underlying neural mechanisms. So we're just going to take a minute or two and describe those for you because they are informative. We all have a brain structure called the amygdala. A lot of people think it's associated with fear but it's actually associated with threat detection and more generally, and I should say more specifically, with detecting what sorts of events in the environment are novel and are linked to particular emotional states. Both positive emotional states and negative emotional states. So the neurons in the amygdala are exquisitely good at figuring out, right, they don't have their own mind but at detecting correlations between sensory events in the environment that trigger the release of adrenaline and what's going on in the brain. And because the amygdala is so extensively interconnected with other areas of the brain. It basically connects to everything and everything connects back to it. The amygdala is in a position to strengthen particular connections in the brain very easily. Provided certain conditions are met. And those conditions are the ones we've been talking about up until now. Emotional saliency that results in increases in epinephrine and cortisol. Or circulating epinephrine and cortisol being much higher than it was 10 minutes or 15 minutes before. And the net effect of the amygdala in this context is to take whatever patterns of neural activity preceded that increase in adrenaline and corticosterone and strengthen those synapses that were involved in that neural activity. So the amygdala doesn't have knowledge. It's not a thinking area. It's a correlation detector. And it's correlating neural chemical states of the brain and body, different patterns of electrical activity in the brain. This is important because it really emphasizes the fact that both negative and positive emotional states and the different but somewhat overlapping chemical states that they create, or the conditions, as we say the and gates through which memory is laid down. And gates will be familiar to those of you who have done a bit of a computer programming. An and gate is simply a condition in which you need one thing and another to happen in order for a third thing to happen. So you need epinephrine elevated and you need robust activity in a particular brain circuit if in fact that brain circuit is going to be strengthened. It's not sufficient to have one or the other, you need both. Hence, the name and gate. And the amygdala is very good at establishing these and gate contingencies. It's also a very generic brain structure in the sense that it doesn't really care what sorts of sensory events are involved provided they correlated in time with that increase in adrenal and corticosterone. This has a wonderful side and a kind of dark side. The dark side is that PTSD and traumas of various kinds often involve an increase in adrenaline because whatever it was that caused the PTSD was indeed very stressful. Caused these big increases in these chemicals. And because the amygdala is rather general in its functions. Right, it's not tuned or designed in any kind of way to be specifically active in response to particular types of sensory events, or perceptions. Well, then what it means is that we can start to become afraid of entire city blocks where one bad thing happened in a particular room of a particular building in a city block. We can become fearful of anyplace that contains a lot of people if something bad happened to us in a place that contained a lot of people. The amygdala is not so much of a splitter, as we say in science. We talk about lumpers and splitters. Lumpers are kind of generalizers, if that's even a word. And I think it is, someone will tell me one way or the other. And splitters are people that are ultra precise and specific and nuanced about every little detail. The amygdala is more of a lumper than a splitter when it comes to sensory events. Other areas of the brain only become active under very, very specific conditions and only those conditions. And similarly, epinephrine is just a molecule. It's just a chemical that's circulating in our brain and body. There's no epinephrine specifically for a cold shower that is distinct from the epinephrine associated with a bad event which is distinct from the epinephrine associated with a really exciting event that makes you really alert. Epinephrine is just a molecule, it's generic. So these systems have a lot of overlap and that can explain, in large part, why when good things happen in particular locations and in the company of particular people, we often generalize to large categories of people, places, and things. And when negative things happen in particular circumstances, we often generalize about people places and things associated with that negative event. So now I'd like to talk about other tools that you can leverage that have been shown in quality, peer-reviewed studies to enhance learning and memory. And perhaps one of the most potent of those tools is exercise. There are numerous studies on this in both animals and fortunately now also in humans. Thanks to the beautiful work of people like Wendy Suzuki from New York University. Wendy's lab has identified how exercise works to enhance learning and memory and other forms of cognition, I should mention. As well as things that can augment, can enhance the effects of exercise on learning and memory and other forms of cognition. Wendy is going to be a guest on this podcast. It's actually the episode that follows this episode. And it includes a lot of material that we have not covered today. And she's an incredible scientist and has some incredible findings that I know everyone is going to find immensely useful. In the meantime, I want to talk about some of the general effects of exercise on learning and memory that she's discovered and that other laboratories have discovered. If you recall earlier, I mentioned that learning and memory almost always involves the strengthening of particular synapses and neural circuits in the brain. And not so much the increase in the number of neurons in the brain. There is one exception, however. And we now have both animal data and some human data to support the fact that cardiovascular exercise seems to increase what we call dentate gyrus neurogenesis. Neurogenesis is the creation of new neurons. The dentate gyrus is a subregion of the hippocampus that's involved in learning and memory of particular kinds. Right, certain types of events, particular contextual learning, but some other things as well. Sometimes involved in spacial learning. There's a lot debate about exactly what the dentate gyrus does, but for the sake of this discussion, and I think everyone in the neuroscience community would agree that the dentate gyrus is important for memory formation and consolidation. The dentate gyrus does seem to be one region in the brain, certainly in the rodent brain, but more and more it's seeming also in the human brain where at least some new neurons are added throughout the lifespan. And, as it turns out, that cardiovascular exercise can increase the proliferation of new neurons in this structure. And that those new neurons, excuse me, are important for the formation of certain types of new memories. There are wonderful data showing that if you use X-irradiation, which is a way to eliminate the formation of those new cells or other tools and tricks to eliminate the formation of those cells that you block the formation of certain kinds of learning and memory. What does this mean? Well, there are a lot of reasons for the statement I'm about to make that extend far beyond neurogenesis and the hippocampus learning and memory. But it's very clear that getting anywhere from 180, or I should say a minimum of 180 to 200 minutes of so called zone two cardiovascular exercise, so this is cardiovascular exercise that can be performed at a pretty steady state which would allow you to just barely hold a conversation. So breathing hard but not super hard. Such as in sprints or high intensity interval training. But doing that for 180 to 200 minutes per week total is it appears the minimum threshold for enhancing some of the longevity effects associated with improvements in cardiovascular fitness and we believe that it is indirectly, I should say indirectly, through enhancements in cardiovascular fitness that there are improvements in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis. What does that mean? The improvements in cardiovascular function are indirectly impacting the ability of the dentate gyrus to create these new neurons. To my knowledge there's no direct relationship between exercise and stimulating the production of new neurons in the brain. It seems that it's the improvement in blood flow that also relate to improvements in things like lymphatic flow, the circulation of lymph fluid within the brain that are enhancing neurogenesis and that neurogenesis, it appears is important. Now in fairness to the landscape of neuroscience and my colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere. There is a lot of debate as to whether or not there is much if any neurogenesis in the adult human brain. But regardless, I think the data are quite clear that the 180 to 200 minutes minimum of cardiovascular exercise is going to be important for other health metrics. Now it is clear that exercise can impact learning and memory through other non-neurogenesis, non-neuron type mechanisms. And one of the more exciting ones that has been studied over the years is this notion of hormones from bone traveling in the blood stream to the brain and enhancing the function of the hippocampus. If the words hormones from bones is surprising to you, I'm here to tell you that yes, indeed, your bones make hormones. We call these endocrine effects. So in biology we hear about autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine. Those different terms refer to over what distance a given chemical has an affect on a cell. For instance, a cell can have an affect on itself. It can have an affect on immediately neighboring cells or it can have an affect on both itself, immediately neighboring cells and cells far, far away in the body. And that last example of a given chemical or substance having and affect on the cell that produced it plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away is an endocrine effect. And a lot of hormones, not all, work in this fashion. Hence why we sometimes hear about endocrine and hormone as kind of synonymous terms. Your bones make chemicals that travel in the blood stream and have these endocrine effects. So they're effectively acting as hormones. And one such chemical is something called osteocalcin. Now these findings arrived to us through various labs but one of the more important labs for the sake of this discussion today is the laboratory of Eric Kandel at Columbia Medical School. Eric is now, I believe in his mid to late 90s, still very sharp. And has studied learning and memory. It also turns out that he is an avid swimmer. Now, I happen to know that Eric swims anywhere from a half a mile to a mile a day. And again, this is anecdotal. I'm not referring to the published data just yet. But he credits that exercise as one of the ways in which he keeps his brain sharp and has indeed kept his brain sharp for many, many decades. And as I mentioned before, he's well into his 90s. So pretty impressive. His laboratory has studied the effects of exercise on hippocampal function and memory. And other laboratories have done that as well. And what they've found is that cardiovascular exercise and perhaps other forms of exercise too, but mainly cardiovascular exercise creates the release of osteocalcin from the bones that travels to the brain and to sub regions of the hippocampus and encourages the electrical activity and formation and maintenance of connections within the hippocampus and keeps the hippocampus functioning well in order to lay down new memories. Now osteocalcin has a lot of effects besides just improving the function of the hippocampus. Osteocalcin is involved in bone growth itself. It's involved in hormone regulation. In fact, there's really nice evidence that it can regulate testosterone and estrogen production by the testes and ovaries. And a bunch of other effects in other organs of the body. Because again, it's acting in this endocrine manner. It's arriving from bone to a lot of different organs to have effects. Load bearing exercise, in particular, turns out to be important for inducing the release of osteocalcin. And when you think about this, it makes sense. A nervous system exists for a lot of reasons, to sense, perceive, etc. You've got taste, you've got smell, you've got hearing. But the vast majority of brain real estate, especially in humans, is dedicated to two things. One, vision. We have an enormous amount of brain real estate devoted to vision. Certainly compared to other senses. And to movement. The ability to generate course movements of the body. The ability, excuse me, to generate fine movements of the body, like the digits, or to wink one eye, or to tilt your head in a particular way, or move your lips and move your face and do all sorts of different things in a very nuanced and detailed way. So much of our brain real estate is devoted to movement that it's been hypothesized for more than a half century, but especially in recent years as we've learned more about the function of the brain in a really detailed circuit level, that the relationship between the brain and body and the maintenance and perhaps even the improvement of the neural circuitry in the brain depends on our body movements and the signal from the body that our brain is still moving. So think about that. How would your brain know if your body was moving regularly and how would it know how much it was moving? How would it know which limbs it was moving? Well, you could say, if the heart rate is increased then the blood flow will be increased and then the brain will know. Ah, but how does your brain know that its increased blood flow due to movement and not to, for instance, just stress, right? Maybe you actually can't move and you're very stressed about that and so the increased blood flow is simply a consequence of increased stress. The fact that osteocalcin is released from bone and in particular can be released in response to load bearing exercise. So this would be running, again weightlifting hasn't been tested directly, but one would imagine anything that involves jumping and landing, or weightlifting, or body weight movements and things of that sort. That's a signal to release osteocalcin, and we know that signal occurs. That is directly reflective of the fact that the body was moving and moving in particular ways. In fact, you could imagine that big bones like your femur are going to release more osteocalcin or be in a position to release more osteocalcin then fine movements like the movements of the digits. And this idea that the body is constantly signaling to the brain about the status of the body and the varying needs of the brain to update its brain circuitry, is a really attractive idea that fits entirely with the biology of exercise, osteocalcin, and hippocampal function. I do want to mention that I'm not the first to raise this hypothesis. This hypothesis actually was discussed in a fair amount of detail by John Ratey who's a professor at Harvard Medical School. He wrote a book called, \"Spark\" which was one of the early books at least from an academic about brain plasticity and the relationship between exercise and movement and plasticity. And John, who I have the good fortune to know, has described to me experiments, or I should say observations of species of ocean dwelling animals that have, at least for the early part of their life, a very robust and complicated nervous system. But then these particular animals are in the habit of plopping down unto a rock. They find kind of a safe, comfy space and they actually stick to that rock and they don't move anymore for a certain portion, I should say the later portion of their life. And it is at the transition between moving a lot and being stationary that those animals actually digest their own brain. The literally metabolize a good portion of their nervous system because they decide, oh, don't need this anymore. And gobble it up, use it for its nutritional value and then sit there like a moron version of themselves with a limited amount of brain tissue because they don't need to move anymore. Now, I certainly don't want to give the message that just moving, just exercise, is sufficient to keep the neural architecture of your brain healthy, young, and able to learn. While that might be true, it's also important to actually engage in attempts to learn new material. Either physical material, so new types of movements and skills and or new types of cognitive information. Languages, mathematics, history, current events. All sorts of things that involve your brain. Nonetheless, it's clear that physical movement and cognitive ability and the potential to enhance cognitive ability and the ability to learn new physical skills are intimately connected. And osteocalcin appears to be at least one way in which that brain-body relationship is established and maintained. So given the information about osteocalcin and movement, and given the information about spiking adrenaline late or after a period of an attempt to learn, you might be asking when is the best time to exercise? Now unfortunately, that has not been addressed in a lot of varying detail, where every sort of variation on the theme has been carried out. And yet, Wendy Suzuki's lab has done really beautiful experiments where they have people exercise, generally it was in the morning. But at other periods of the day as well. And what they find is that at least as late as two hours after that exercise, there is an enhancement in learning and memory. Now I want to be clear, we don't know whether or not that exercise led to big increases in adrenaline. It may be that those forms of exercise were modest enough, or didn't challenge people enough that they merely got a lot of blood flow going and that the improvements in learning and memory were related to blood flow and we presume increases in osteocalcin. However, you could imagine a couple of different logical protocols based on what we've talked about. Let's say you were going to do a form of exercise that was going to spike adrenaline a lot. So this would be exercise that really challenges your system and forces you to kind of push through a burn. Right, so here I'm mainly thinking about cardiovascular exercise. But it could even be yoga, it could be resistance training. If it's going to give you a big spike in adrenaline, it's going to take some serious effort, then logically speaking you would want to place that after a learning about in order to increase learning and memory. However, if you're using the exercise in order to enhance blood flow and to enhance osteocalcin release. In efforts to augment the function of your hippocampus, I think it stands to reason that doing that exercise sometime within the hour to three hours preceding an attempt to learn makes a lot of sense. And there I'm basing it on the human data from Wendy Suzuki's lab. I'm basing it on the studies from Eric Kandel and from others labs. Again, right now, there hasn't been an evaluation of a lot of different protocols to arrive at the peer-reviewed laboratory super protocol. However, since what we're talking about is using activities like exercise that most of us probably, perhaps all of us, should be doing regularly anyway. And I do believe most if not all of us should regularly be trying to learn and keep our brain functioning well and acquire new knowledge. Because it's just a wonderful part of life. And there is evidence that actually can keep your brain young, so to speak. Well then, exercising either before or after a learning about makes a lot of sense. With the emphasis on after a learning about if the form of exercise spikes a lot of adrenaline for all the reasons we talked about before. Okay, so we've talked about two major categories of protocols to improve memory that are grounded in quality, peer reviewed science. And there is yet another third protocol that we'll talk about in a few minutes. But before we do that, I want to briefly touch on an aspect of memory, in fact, two aspects of memory that I get a lot of questions about. The first one is photographic memory. To be clear, there are people out there who have a true photographic memory. They can look at a page of text, they can scan it with their eyes, and they can essentially commit that to memory with very little if any effort. While it might seem that having a photographic memory is a very attractive skill to have, I should caution you against believing that because it turns out that people with true photographic memory are often very challenged at remembering things that they hear. And often times are not so good at learning physical skills. It's not always the case, but often that's the case. So be careful what you wish for. If you do have a photographic memory there are certain professions that lend themselves particularly well to you. And indeed a lot of people with photographic memory have to find a profession and have to move through life in a way that is in concert with that photographic memory. So again, it's a super ability, it's a hyper ability and yet it's not necessarily one that is desirable for most people. There's also this category of what are called super recognizers. These people are, I should mention, highly employable by government agencies. These are people that have an absolutely astonishing ability to recognize faces and to match faces to templates. They can look at a photograph of say somebody on a most wanted list and then they can look at video footage of let's say an airport, or a mall, or a city street at fairly low resolution and they can spot the person who's face matches that photograph that they looked at. Even if that video or other footage is of people's profiles or even the tops of their heads and just a portion of their forehead. These people have just an incredible ability to recognize faces and to template match. And again, these people often will take jobs with agencies where this sort of thing is important. Some of you out there probably are super recognizers and may or may not notice it. If you've ever had the experience of watching a movie and thought to yourself, wow, her mouth looks so much like my cousin's mouth. Or you look at a character in a movie or a television show and you think, wow, they look almost like the younger sister of so and so. Well, then it's very likely that you have this, or at least a mild form of this super recognizer ability. That is not memory per se. That is the hyper functioning of an area of the brain that we call the fusiform gyrus. The fusiform gyrus is literally a face recognition area, and a face template matching area. And it harbors neurons that respond to faces generally. So as humans and other non-human primates, we care a lot about faces and their emotional content. And the identity of faces is super important to us for all the kinds of reasons that are probably obvious. Knowing who's friend, who's foe. Who do you know well? Who's famous, who's not famous? Etc. That is not memory, per se. And yet, if you're a super recognizer, or I guess you could call it a moderate face recognizer or not very good at recognizing faces because indeed, there are some people that are kind of face blind. They don't actually recognize people when they walk in the room. I used to work with somebody like this. I'd walk into his office and he'd say, are you Rich or are you Andrew? And I would say, well am I rich, rich. Like, you know, wealth rich? No. And he'd say, no, are you Richard or are you Andrew? And I'd say, I'm Andrew. We know each other really well. And he'd say, oh I'm sorry. I'm kind of face blind. And it actually tended to be better or worse depending on how much he was working. Ironically, the more rested he was the more face blind he would become. So it wasn't a sleep deprivation thing. That exists, that's out there. There's the full constellation of people's ability to recognize faces. That's not really memory. And yet, visual function is a profoundly powerful way in which we can enhance our memories. So whether or not you're a super recognizer of faces, whether or not you are face blind or anything in between. Next I'm going to tell you about a study which points out the immense value of visual images for laying down memories. And you can leverage this information and this involves both the taking of photographs, something that's quite easily done these days with your phone. As well as your ability to take mental photographs by literally snapping your eyelids shut. So I just briefly want to describe this paper because it provides a tool that you can leverage in your attempt to learn and remember things better. The title of this paper is Photographic Memory, the Effects of our Volitional Photo-Taking on Memory for Visual and Auditory Aspects of an Experience. I really like this paper because it refers to photographic memory not in the context of photographic memory that we normally hear about where people are truly photographic, look at a page and somehow absorb all that information and commit it to memory. But rather the use of camera photographs or the use of mental camera photographs. Literally looking at something deciding, blink, snapping a, so to speak, snapping a snapshot of whatever it is that you are looking at and remembering the content. The reason I like this paper and the reason I'm attracted to this issue of mental snapshots is this is something that I've been doing since I was a kid. I don't know why I started doing it, but every once in a while, I would say maybe twice a year I would look at something and decide to just snap a mental snapshot of it. And I've maintained very clear memories of those visual scenes. Two years ago I was in an Uber and I looked out the window and it was a street scene. I was actually in New York at the time and I decided for reasons that are still unclear to me, to take a mental snapshot of this city street image. Even though nothing interesting in particular was happening. And I do recall that there was a guy wearing a yellow shirt walking, there was some construction, etc. I can still see that image in my mind's eye because I took this mental snapshot. This paper addresses whether or not this mental snapshotting thing is real and this is something I think a lot of people will resonate with, whether or not the constant taking of pictures on our phones or with other devices is either improving or degrading our memory. You could imagine an argument for both. A lot of people are taking pictures that they never look at again. And so in a sense, they're outsourcing their visual memory of events into their phone or some other device and they're not ever accessing the actual image again. They're not looking at it, right? You're not printing out those photos. You're not scanning through your phone again. Sometimes you might do that, but most of the time people don't. Most of the photographs people are taking they're not revisiting again. So the motivation for this study was that previous experiments had shown that if people take photos of a scene or a person, or an object, that they are actually less good at remembering the details of that scene or object, etc. This study challenged that idea and raised the hypothesis that if people are allowed to choose what they take photos of, that taking photos, again, this is with the camera, not mental snapshotting. That taking those photos would actually enhance their memory for those objects, those places, those people, and in fact, details of those objects, places, and people. And indeed, that's what they found. So in contrast to previous studies where people had been more or less told, take photos of these following objects, or these following people, or these following places and then they were given a memory test at some point later. In this study people were given volitional control, right? They were given agency in making the decision of what to take photos of. And I'll just summarize the results. We'll provide a link to this study. I should say that some of the stuff that they tested was actually pretty challenging. Some of them were pottery and other forms of ceramics that are of the sort that you see if you go to a big museum in a big city. And if you've ever done that, and you see all the different objects, there are a lot of details in those objects and a lot of those objects look a lot alike. And so someone will have two handles. Some will have one handle. The position of the handles. How broad or narrow these things are. You know, a lot of this is pretty detailed stuff. They also took photos of other things. So basically what they found was that if people take pictures of things and they choose which things they are taking pictures of, right. It's up to them, it's volitional. That there's enhanced memory for those objects later on. However, it degraded their ability to remember auditory information. So what this means is that when we take a picture of something, or a person, we are stamping down a visual memory of that thing. And that makes sense, it's a photograph after all. But we are actually inhibiting our ability to remember the auditory, the sound component of that visual scene or what the person was saying. Very interesting. And points to the fact that the visual system can out compete the auditory system, at least in terms of how the hippocampus is encoding this information. The other finding I find particularly interesting within this study is that it didn't matter whether or not they ever looked at the photos again. So they actually had people take photos, or not take photos of different objects. They had some people keep their photos and they had other people delete the photos. And it turns out that whether or not people kept the photos or deleted those photos had no bearing on whether or not they were better or worse at remembering things. They were always better at remembering them as compared to not taking photos of them. What does this mean? It means that if you really want to remember something or somebody, take a photo of that thing or person. Pay attention while you take the photo. But it doesn't really matter if you look at the photo again. Somehow the process of taking that photo, probably looking at it. You know, in a camera typically we'd say through the viewfinder or now because of digital cameras on the screen on the back of that camera, or on your phone, that framing up of the photograph stamps down a visual image in your mind that is more robust at serving a memory then had you just looked at that thing with your own eyes. Very interesting and it raises all sorts of questions for me about whether or not it's because you're framing up a small aperture or a small portion of the visual scene. That's one logical interpretation, although they didn't test that. I should also say that they found that whether or not that you looked at a photo that you took, or whether or not you deleted it and never looked at it again, didn't just enhance visual memory or the memory from the visual components of that image but it always reduced your ability to remember sounds associated with that experience. So that's interesting. And then last but not least, and perhaps most interesting, at least to me, was the fact that you didn't even need a camera to see this effect. If subjects looked at something and took a mental photograph of that thing, it enhanced their visual memory of that thing significantly more than had they not taken a mental picture. In fact, it increased their memory of that thing almost as much as taking an actual photograph with an actual camera. And the reason I find this so interesting is that a lot of what we try and learn is visual. And for a lot of people, the ability to learn visual information feels challenging. And we'll look at something and we'll try and create some detailed understanding of it. We'll try and understand the relationships between things in that scene. It does appear based on this study that the mere decision to take a mental snapshot, like, okay I'm going to blink my eyelids and I'm going to take a snapshot of whatever it is I see, can actually stamp down a visual memory much in the same way that a camera can stamp down a visual memory. Of course, through vastly distinct mechanisms. No discussion of memory would be complete without a discussion of the ever intriguing phenomenon known as deja vu. This is a sense that we've experienced something before but we can't quite put our finger on it. Where and when did it happen? Or the sense that we've been someplace before. Or that we are in a familiar state or place or context of some kind. Now, I've talked about this on the podcast before, at least, I think I have. And the way this works has been defined largely by the wonderful work of Susumu Tonegawa at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT. Susumu collected a Nobel Prize, quite appropriately, for his beautiful work on immunology. And he's also a highly accomplished neuroscientist who studies memory and learning and deja vu. And I should also mention the beautiful work of Mark Mayford at the Scripps Institute and UC San Diego. Beautiful work on this notion of deja vu. Here's what they discovered. They evaluated the patterns of neural firing in the hippocampus as subjects learn new things. Okay, so neuron A fires, then neuron B fires, then neuron C fires in a particular sequence. Again, the firing of neurons in a particular sequence like the playing of keys on a piano in a particular sequence leads to a particular song on the piano and leads to a particular memory of an experience within the brain. They then used some molecular tools and tricks to label and capture those neurons such that they could go back later and activate those neurons in either the same sequence or in a different sequence to the one that occurred during the formation of the memory. To make a long story short, and to summarize multiple papers published in incredibly high tier journals, journals like Nature and Science which are extremely stringent, found that whether or not those particular neurons were played in the precise sequence that happened when they encoded the memory or whether or not those neurons were played in a different sequence, or even if those neurons were played, activated that is, all at once with no temporal sequence. All firing in concert all at once, evoked the same behavior. And in some sense, the same memory. So at a neural circuit level, this is deja vu. This is a different pattern of firing of neurons in the brain leading to the same sense of what happened, leading to a particular emotional state or behavior. Whether or not this same sort of phenomenon occurs when you're walking down the street and suddenly you feel as if, wow, I feel like I've been here before. You meet someone and you feel like, gosh I feel like I know you. I feel like there's some familiarity here that I can't quite put my finger on. We don't know for sure that's what's happening but this is the most mechanistic and logical explanation for what has for many decades, if not hundreds of years, has been described as deja vu. So for those of you that experience deja vu often, just know that this reflects a normal pattern of encoding experiences and events within your hippocampus. I'm not aware of any pathological situations where the presence of deja vu inhibits daily life. Some people like the sensation of deja vu. Other people don't. Almost everybody, however, describes it as somewhat eerie. This idea that even though you're in a very different place, even though you're interacting with a very different person, that you could somehow feel as if this has happened before. And just realize this, that your hippocampus, while it is exquisitely good at encoding new types of perceptions, new experiences, new emotions, new contingencies and relationships of life events, it is not infinitely large nor does it have an infinite bucket full of different options of different sequences for those neurons to play. So in a lot of ways it makes perfect sense that sometimes we would feel as if a given experience had happened previously. I'd like to cover one additional tool that you can use to improve learning and memory. And I should mention, this is a particularly powerful one and it's one that I'm definitely going to employ myself. This is based on a paper from none other than Wendy Suzuki at New York University. We talked about her a little bit earlier. And again, she's going to be on the podcast in our next episode. And is just an incredible researcher. I've known Wendy for a number of years and it's only in the last, I would say five or six years that she's really shifted her laboratory toward generating protocols that human beings can use. And she's putting that to great effect, great positive effect I should say. Publishing papers of the sort that I'm about to describe. But also incorporating some of these tools and protocols into the learning curriculum and the lifestyle curriculum of students at NYU. Which I think is a terrific initiative. So you don't need to be an NYU student in order to benefit from her work. I'm going to tell you about some of that work now and she'll tell you about this and much more in the episode that follows this one. The title of this paper will tell you a lot about where we're going. The title is Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory, Mood, and Emotional Regulation in Non-Experienced Meditators. If ever there was an incentive to meditate, it is the data contained within this paper. I want to briefly describe the study and then I also want to emphasize that when you meditate is absolutely critical. I'll talk about that just at the end. This is a study that involves subjects aged 18 to 45. None of whom were experienced mediators prior to this study. There were two general groups in this study. One group did a 13 minute long meditation and this meditation was a fairly conventional meditation. They would sit or lie down. They would do somewhat of a body scan, evaluating for instance how tense or relaxed they felt throughout their body and they would focus on their breathing. Trying to bring their attention back to their breathing and to the state of their body as the meditation progressed. The other group, which we can call the control group listened to of all things, a podcast. They did not listen to this podcast. They listened to Radio Lab, which is a popular podcast, for an equivalent amount of time. But they were not instructed to do any kind of body scan or pay attention to their breathing. Every subject in the study either meditated daily or listened to a equivalent duration podcast daily for a period of eight weeks. And the experimenters measured a large number of things, of variables, as we say. They looked at measures of emotion regulation. They actually measured cortisol, a stress hormone. They measured, as the title suggests, attention and memory and so forth. And the basic takeaway of this study is that eight weeks but not four weeks of this daily 13 minute a day mediation had a significant effect in improving attention, memory, mood, and emotion regulation. I find this study to be very interesting and in fact, important because most of us have heard about the positive effects of meditation on things like stress reduction. Or on things such as improving sleep. And I want to come back to sleep in a few moments because it turns out to be very important feature of this study. This particular study I like so much because they used a really broad array of measurements for cognitive function. Things like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. I'm not going to go into this. Things like the Stroop Task and they also, as I mentioned, measured cortisol. And many other things, including, not surprisingly, memory. And people's ability to remember certain types of information, in fact varied types of information. And the basic takeaway was, again, that you could get really robust improvements in learning and memory, mood and attention from just 13 minutes a day of meditation. Now there's an important twist in this study that I want to emphasize. If you read into the discussion of the study it's mentioned that somehow meditation did not improve but actually impaired sleep quality compared to the control subjects. And you might think, wow, why would that be? I mean, meditation is supposed to reduce our stress. Stress is supposed to inhibit sleep. And therefore why would sleep get worse? Well, what's interesting is the time of day when most of these subjects tended to do their meditation. Most of the subjects in this study did their meditation late in the day. This is often the case in experiments. I know this because we run experiments with human subjects in my laboratory and people are paid some amount of money in order to participate or they're given something as compensation for being in the study. But often times the meditation, or in the case of my lab, the respiration work or other kinds of things that they're assigned to do are not their top, top priority. And we understand this. But in this study, the majority of subjects here I'm reading completed their meditation sessions from somewhere between 8:00 and 11:00 P.M. And sometimes even between 12:00 and 3:00 A.M. I think there probably were a lot of college students enrolled in this study. And their hours often are late shifted. That impaired sleep. And this raises a bigger theme that I think is important. Many times before on this podcast and certainly in the episode on mastering sleep and conquering or mastering stress those episodes we talked about the value, again, of these non-sleep deep rest protocols, NSDR, for reducing the activity of your sympathetic nervous system. The alertness, so-called stress arm of your autonomic nervous system. The one that makes you feel really alert. NSDR is superb for reducing your level of alertness, increasing your level of calmness, and putting you into a so-called more parasympathetic, relaxed state. Meditation does that too, but it also increases attention. If you think about meditation, meditation involves focusing on your breath and constantly focusing back on your breath and trying to avoid the distraction of things you're thinking or things that you're hearing. And coming, so-called, back to your body, back to your breath. So meditation is actually, it has a high attentional load. It requires a lot of prefrontal cortical activity that's involved in attention. Which then logically relates to one of the outcomes of this study which is that attention ability is improved in daily meditators. It also points out that increasing the level of attention and the activity of your prefrontal cortex may, and I want to emphasize may, because here I'm speculating about the underlying mechanism, inhibit your ability to fall asleep. So while we have meditation on the one hand that does tend to put us into a calm state but it is a calm, very focused state. In fact, attention and focus are inherent to most forms of meditation. Non-sleep deep rest, such as Yoga Nidra as some of you know it to be. Or NSDR, there's a terrific NSDR script that's available free online that's put out by Madefor. So you can go to YouTube, NSDR, Madefor. You can also go do a search for NSDR. There's a number of these available out there, again, at no cost. Those NSDR protocols tend to put people into a state of deep relaxation but also very low attention. And we have to assume very low activation of the prefrontal cortex. So the takeaways from this study are several fold. First of all, that daily meditation of 13 minutes can enhance your ability to pay attention and to learn. It can truly enhance memory. However, you need to do that for at least eight weeks in order to start to see the effects to occur and we have to presume that you have to continue those meditation training sessions. In fact, they found that if people only did four weeks of meditation these effects didn't show up. Now eight weeks might seem like a long time, but I think that 13 minutes a day is not actually that big of a time commitment. And the results of this study certainly incentivize me to start adopting a, I'm going for 15 minutes a day now. I've been an on and off meditator for a number of years. I've been pretty good about it lately, but I confess I've been doing far shorter meditations of anywhere from three to five, or maybe 10 minutes. I'm going to ramp that up to 15 minutes a day. And I'm doing that specifically to try and access these improvements in cognitive ability and our abilities to learn. Also based on the data in this paper, I'm going to do those meditation sessions either early in the day, such as immediately after waking, or close to it. So I might get my sunshine first. I'm, as you all know, very big on getting sunlight in the eyes early in the day. As much as one can and as early as one can. Once the sun is out. But certainly doing it early in the day and not past 5:00 P.M. or so in order to make sure that I don't inhibit sleep. Because I think this, the result that they describe of meditation inhibiting quality sleep compared to controls is an important one to pay attention to. No pun intended. Today we covered a lot of aspects of memory and how to improve your memory. We talked about the different forms of memory and we talked about some of the underlying neural circuitry of memory formation and we talked about the emotional saliency and intensity of what you're trying to learn has a profound impact on whether or not you learn in response to some sort of experience. Whether or not that experience is reading, or mathematics, or music, or language, or a physical skill. It doesn't matter. The more intense of an emotional state that you're in in the period immediately following that learning, the more likely you are to remember whatever it is that you're trying to learn. And we talked about the neuro chemicals that explain that effect. About epinephrine and corticosterones like cortisol. And how adjusting the timing of those is so key to enhancing your memory. And we talked about the different ways to enhance those chemicals. Everything ranging from cold water to pharmacology and even just adjusting the emotional state within your mind in order to stamp down and remember experiences better. We also talked about how to leverage exercise, in particular, load bearing exercise in order to evoke the release of hormones like osteocalcin which can travel from your bones to your brain and enhance your ability to learn. And we talked about a new form of photographic memory. Not the traditional type of photographic memory in which people can remember everything they look at very easily. But rather, taking mental snapshots of things that you see. Again, emphasizing that will create a better memory of what you see when you take that mental snapshot, but will actually reduce your memory for the things that you hear at that moment. And we discussed the really exciting data looking at how particular meditation protocols can enhance memory but also attention and mood. However, if done too late in the day, can actually disrupt sleep precisely because those meditation protocols can enhance attention. Now I know that many of you are interested in neuro chemicals that can enhance learning and memory. And I intend to cover those in deep detail in a future episode. However, for the sake of what was discussed today, please understand that any number of different neuro chemicals can evoke or can increase the amount of adrenaline that's circulating in your brain and body. And it's less important how one accesses that increase in adrenaline. Again, this can be done through behavioral protocols or through pharmacology. Assuming that those behavioral protocols and pharmacology are safe for you, it really doesn't matter how you evoke the adrenaline release because remember, adrenaline is the final common pathway by which particular experiences, particular perceptions are stamped into memory. Which answers our very first question raised at the beginning of the episode. Which is, why do we remember anything at all? Right, that was the question that we raised. Why is it that from morning 'til night throughout your entire life you have tons of sensory experience, tons of perceptions. Why is it that some are remembered and others are not? While I would never want to distill an important question such as that down to a one molecule type of answer, I think we can confidently say based on the vast amount of animal and human research data that epinephrine, adrenaline, and some of the other chemicals that it acts with in concert, is in fact, the way that we remember particular events and not all events.

During today's episode and on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them. For things like enhancing sleep and focus and indeed, for learning and memory. For that reason the Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous Supplements. The reason we've partnered with Momentous is several fold. First of all, we wanted to have one location where people could go to access single ingredient, high quality versions of the supplements that we were discussing on this podcast. This is a critical issue. A lot of supplement companies out there sell excellent supplements but they combine different ingredients into different formulations which make it very hard to figure out exactly what works for you and to arrive at the minimal effective dose of the various compounds that are best for you. Which we think is extremely important and that's certainly the most scientific way and rigorous way to approach any kind of supplementation regime. So Momentous has made these single ingredient formulations on the basis of what we suggested to them and I'm happy to say, they also ship internationally. So whether or not you're in the US or abroad, they'll ship to you. If you'd like to see the supplements recommended on the Huberman Lab Podcast, you can go to LiveMomentous.com/Huberman. They've started to assemble the supplements that we've talked about on the podcast and in the upcoming weeks they will be adding many more supplements such that in a brief period of time most, if not all of the compounds that are discussed on this podcast will be there, again, in single ingredient, extremely high quality formulations that you can use to arrive at the best supplement protocols for you. We also include behavioral protocols that can combined with supplementation protocols in order to deliver the maximum effect. Once again, that's LiveMomentous.com/Huberman. And if you're not already following us on Twitter and Instagram, it's HubermanLab on both Twitter and Instagram. There I describe science and science related tools. Some of which overlap with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast. We also have a newsletter called the Huberman Lab Neural Network. That newsletter provides summary protocols and information from our various podcast episodes. It does not cost anything to sign up. You can go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu and click on newsletter. You just provide your email and I should point out, we do not share your email with anyone else. We have a very clear privacy policy that you can read there. And that newsletter comes out about once a month. You can also see some sample newsletters. Things like the toolkit for sleep, or for neural plasticity and for various other topics covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast. Once again, thank you for joining me today to discuss the neurobiology of learning and memory and how to improve your memory using science based tools. And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science. [light music]",

    "summary": "Memory is not just about learning. It's about how your immediate experiences relate to previous and future experiences. And there's science that points to specific tools for enhancing learning and memory. And that too is a biological process for which great tools exist. So today you're going to learn about the systems in the brain and body that establish memories. You're going to learn why certain memories are easier to form than others. And you can also leverage that same knowledge to better forget or unload the emotional weight of experiences that you did not like.\nIn this episode, we discuss the neurobiology of learning and memory, and how to improve your memory using science-based tools. We cover two major categories of protocols to improve memory that are grounded in quality, peer-reviewed science. The first is the use of exercise to improve memory. The second is the use of visual images to improve memory. We also discuss the phenomenon of deja vu, and how it relates to the neurobiology of memory. We also discuss a study that shows how brief daily meditation can enhance attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators. We also discuss the neurochemicals that underlie the effects of exercise on memory, and how they can be accessed through behavioral protocols or through pharmacology.\n",

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we're talking all about goals and the science of goal setting and achieving your goals. There's a tremendous amount of information on the internet and in books and so forth, about how to set goals and assess your progress towards goals and update your goals and so forth. In fact, there are so many programs out there, that includes so many different acronyms that it can be a little bit overwhelming. Today's conversation about goals, is going to be quite a bit different. Indeed, we are going to talk about setting goals. We are also going to talk about how to assess progress towards goals. And we are going to talk about goal execution. However, we're going to do all of this in the context of neuroscience, because it turns out that there are not hundreds or dozens or even several neural circuits in your brain, that control goal setting and movement toward your goals. There is one and while it includes many different brain areas, that one circuit is the same circuit, that's responsible for pursuing all goals. And it relates to some very basic neurochemical mechanisms that are understood. So while there's a wealth of information out there about goals and goal setting and goal achievement and so forth, there's comparatively little information that's been available to the public about the neuroscience of goal setting and goal achievement. So that's what we're going to focus on today. I promise that we're going to get into the neuroscience, we're going to touch on a little bit of the psychology and how the neuroscience relates to what's known in the psychology literature. And we are going to establish several, in fact, four specific protocols that you can use for goal setting, goal assessment and goal execution in an ongoing basis, regardless of what your personal goals happen to be. Before we dive into our conversation about goals and goal setting and goal achievement, I'd like to highlight some recent scientific findings, that I think are going to be interesting and actionable for many of you out there. In earlier podcasts, we talked about neuro-plasticity, which is the brain's ability to change in response to experience. In fact, neuroplasticity underlies all forms of learning, whether or not it's language learning or learning music or math or a physical skill, all forms of learning involve the reorganization of connections in the nervous system, the brain and spinal cord and body. One of the key principles of neuroplasticity, is this notion of making errors as a good thing toward neuroplasticity. It is a little bit counterintuitive, but what the scientific literature tells us, is that whenever we're trying to learn something new, if we make an error, we know it feels frustrating, but that state of frustration, actually queues up particular brain areas to be more alert, so that on subsequent attempts to learn that thing, we have a heightened level of focus and a higher probability of learning the new skill, regardless of what that skill is. And I've talked about this before in various episodes, as encouraging people to embrace errors or pursue errors, not as their own end goal, but errors as an entry point for making the brain more plastic. And if you think about it really makes sense, why would the brain change at all, if it's performing everything perfectly? When you make errors, well in the immediate seconds and minutes after those errors, you are in a better position to learn. A common question I get, however, is what should be the rate of errors? Which is really just a way of saying, how hard should the given task be that you're trying to learn or perform? And it turns out there's an answer. There's a recent paper that was published in a great journal, \"Nature Communications\". This is a paper, our last author, Jonathan Cohen, and the paper is entitled, \"The Eighty Five Percent Rule for optimal learning\". This paper, we will make available by a link in the show note captions, but basically what this paper shows, is that when trying to learn something new, you want to make the difficulty of what you're trying to learn, such that, you are getting things right about 85% of the time. That you're making errors about 15% of the time. And the reason I like this paper, is it really points specifically to some protocols that we can implement because people always say, okay, you want to set a high goal. You want to try and achieve something that's really lofty, but you don't want to make the goal so lofty that you don't make any progress at all. Other people say, you really want to start with really small goals and make things very, very incremental. Only set out to do things that you know you can accomplish and that will feed back on your self-esteem and all these positive feedback loops. And then, you know, layer by layer, layer by layer, you'll eventually get where you want to go. Well, it turns out that neither is true you need to set the level of difficulty, such that you're making errors about 15% of the time. And I want to emphasize about 15% of the time, because there's no way to figure protocols for sport or language or math or anything else, where you're going to have exactly 15% errors. So, anyway, this paper, the 85% rule for optimal learning, again, we will supply the link, but it really points to the idea of making things pretty hard, but not so hard that you're failing every attempt or even half of the attempts. Failing about 15% of the time seems optimal for learning. Hopefully that information will be useful to any of you that are trying to learn something. Hopefully it will also be useful to those of you that are teaching kids or other adults. If you're teaching, keep in mind that you want to keep the students reaching for higher and higher levels of proficiency in whatever that is that you're teaching. And that 15% of the time they should be failing, if it gets to 20%, that's probably okay. If they start failing about half the time, then probably what they're trying to learn is too difficult for them at that point. Now, of course, this is going to be controlled by all sorts of external factors, like whether or not they slept well the night before, whether or not you slept well the night before and you're being clear in your instructions to them, et cetera. But I think the 15% rule as we may call it, is a good metric to aim for and it can serve both students and teachers. In other words, it can serve both those teaching and those that are learning. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast, is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort, to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT, LMNT is an electrolyte drink mixed with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means lots of salt, some other electrolytes and no sugar. As I've mentioned before on this podcast and in various interviews, I'm a big fan of salt. I sort of discovered this a few years ago, when \"Science Magazine\", one of the pre-eminent magazines out there, that publishes research on science, but also news articles about science, talked about the myth of salt research. It turns out, that contrary to what I had believed, which was that salt is going to cause hypertension or that salt is really bad for us. There's an innate need for salt in our system and indeed, if you dive into the textbooks on salt balance, we have entire biological systems of our kidneys and fluid management, et cetera, that are involved in making sure that we get enough salt. In fact, neurons, nerve cells, function because salt, sodium actually enters those cells quickly and that's what causes them to fire action potentials. The common syllable or a language of neurons, if you will, when we are low in sodium, our neurons don't work as well. And a few years later, I had the experience of feeling kind of shaky and I thought I had blood sugar issues. I went and got my blood sugar checked and it was fine. And a physician made the recommendation, that I actually up my salt intake. My intake wasn't particularly low, I didn't think, but I quickly found, was that if I consumed enough salt, usually I would do this in the form of putting a little pinch of salt into some water, adding a little lemon juice or something like that, or salting my food a little bit more. That I lost any kind of shakiness in my hands, that my mental functioning was better, my sports performance was better, et cetera. So it was really interesting to see that shift simply by increasing my salt intake, something that's really counterintuitive, to a lot of what's out there. Salt isn't just important for the function of neurons, it's important for blood volume and working alongside the other electrolytes, magnesium and potassium, it ensures that cells in our body function properly. And I think we're starting to see a shift out there now, in the perception of what salt and the other electrolytes do. And really seeing magnesium, which is one of the electrolytes, potassium and especially salt, as not necessarily something to avoid, but in fact something to embrace, provided that they're used properly. LMNT is formulated to help anyone, reach their electrolyte needs and is particularly well-suited to people following a keto, low carb or paleo diet. For people following a low carb diet or doing intermittent fasting, what many people don't know, is that carbohydrate holds water. It actually brings water into the system and you don't want your system to be low on water, that's one form of dehydration.. Salt holds water as well, meaning it keeps the water in your system, which is beneficial for brain and body function. LMNT contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium. And they use the very best forms of salt, potassium, and magnesium that are out there. So the way I use LMNT, is I usually will mix up one packet into about 16 to 30 ounces of water in the morning and drink that first thing in the morning when I wake up or around breakfast time, doesn't really matter. I kind of sip on it through the morning or if I'm really thirsty, I'll drink it all at once. And then I always make sure to drink a volume of water with an LMNT packet in it, somewhere around my exercise. Sometimes it's during the exercise, if I'm running, I'll wait until afterwards. I'll hydrate with it before and after, if it's a really hot day. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drinklmnt, that's L-M-N-T.com/huberman, to claim a free element sample pack. You only cover the cost of shipping, otherwise it's completely free. Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral, probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens, is that it covers all of my foundational vitamin, mineral, probiotic needs. We of course need vitamins. We of course need minerals and we do need a healthy gut microbiome and probiotics, support a healthy gut microbiome. There is now a wealth of quality scientific published data, showing that the microbiota, meaning the little microbes that live in our gut, are good for us. And our gut when it functions properly, communicates with our brain and our brain communicates with our gut through the so-called, gut-brain axis. And that gut-brain axis, is vital for things like immune system, endocrine system, meaning hormones and for mood and overall brain function. With Athletic Greens, I get my vitamins, my minerals and the probiotics I need, to support a healthy gut microbiome and gut-brain axis without having to worry about taking a bunch of other things. In fact, when people ask me, what's the one supplement I should take, that's going to make me feel better? I always say Athletic Greens because indeed it makes me feel better and it happens to taste terrific. I drink it twice a day, typically, I'll have one in the morning, I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon or lime juice. And I'll typically have it again in the afternoon or late afternoon, again, mixed with water, some lemon or lime juice. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens, while you're in the car or traveling by plane, et cetera. Plus, they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3 + K2. Many of us are deficient in vitamin D3 and even for those of us that are getting sufficient sunshine, many of us still need to supplement with vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is involved in metabolism, immune system, brain function, hormones, et cetera. It has so many important functions, and K2 has been shown to be important for a variety of things, not the least, which is cardiovascular health. So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you can claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, plus a year supply of vitamin D3 + K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman, to claim this special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses, that have the absolute highest quality. I spent a lifetime working on the science of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system everywhere from your eyes to your brain, includes a ton of different mechanisms, so that as you move through different environments, you can see things clearly. And even if it's bright out or there are shadows or it's really dim outside, or it's getting dark, that your visual system can try and manage, to resolve what's out there in the world, so you can see things clearly. Many people need corrective lenses, they need eyeglasses. Other people, they need sunglasses as well, or just simply need sunglasses because if it's too bright, it's very hard to see things. One problem with a lot of eyeglasses and sunglasses out there, however, is they don't take into account, the nuanced biology, the visual system. You may have experienced this. Have you ever put on a pair of sunglasses that aren't so great? You move from a really bright area into a dimly lit area and you have to take the eyeglasses off, your eyes just don't seem to adjust. With ROKA, eyeglasses and sunglasses, everything they've done to design those glasses and lenses, is with the science of the visual system in mind. So you can move seamlessly from one environment to the next and you always see things with crystal clarity. Their sunglasses and eyeglasses are really terrific because they can be used for anything. They have a terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them, to work to dinner, et cetera, they look great. And, they're also designed for athletic performance, you can use them while running or while cycling, if you get sweaty, they won't slip off your face. They're extremely lightweight, in fact, I often forget that they're even on my face. I wear readers at night and sometimes when I drive and I wear sunglasses when it's really bright outside and I need sunglasses. If you want to try ROKA eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to roka.com That's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman, to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman at checkout. Let's talk about the science and in particular, the biology and neuroscience of setting and achieving goals. Setting and achieving goals, is not a uniquely human endeavor. Other animals set and attempt to achieve goals, a honeybee attempts to collect honey and bring it back to the hive. A herbivore will go out and forage for plants and will also have a need to reproduce at some point in its life. So, will need to find a mate and maybe even raise the young, depending on what species that is. Predators will have to hunt and kill and eat their food and they have to avoid getting injured in that process. They also have to raise young, et cetera. So humans are among the other animals, or we could say the animals are among us in the need to set goals and to make efforts to achieve those goals. Now, why do I emphasize this commonality of process? The reason I emphasize this commonality of process, is that it turns out that there is one basic system by which all animals, including humans, set and attempt to achieve goals. Now humans are unique in our ability to orient our mind toward immediate goals, moderately termed goals, meaning things that might exist on the scale of a week or a month or even a year and very long-term goals, like a lifetime goal or a goal that lasts a decade, or it takes a decade to achieve. That's what makes us unique. And of course we don't have access to the mindset or the thinking or the emotions of other animals, but what we do know is that, common neural circuits, meaning brain areas, that are present in animal species and in humans, are responsible for orienting our thinking and our action toward particular goals. Another thing that's really unique about the human brain, is that we are able to have multiple goals interacting at once. So, for instance, we probably all have fitness goals, goals in relationships of different kinds, friendships, and romantic partnerships as well as maybe scholastic goals. Maybe you're in school or you're pursuing some kind of learning outside of the school environment or indoor, you have business goals or financial goals, we are able to have multiple goals at once. And other animals do this, but humans are unique in the ability to juggle a lot of goals. And actually one of the major challenges in pursuing goals, is that goal pursuit often interacts, meaning if you can spend 100% of your time chasing one particular goal, that might be very effective for that goal, but then we tend to fall back on some of our other goals. You can imagine how this plays out. If you're working very, very hard, you're solely focused on business often, your health will suffer. If you're solely focused on your health often, other things will suffer. And so we have to juggle both our goal setting and our goal pursuits. And so today, we're going to talk about a number of different ways, to work with what could very well be called, these interleaving goals, by focusing on a common practice or common set of mechanisms that are present in all aspects of goal seeking. What is that process? Well, it turns out, it's a neural circuit. A neural circuit, is simply a collection of brain areas, that when active in a particular sequence give rise to a particular behavior or perception. So for instance, when you feel happy, it's not because you have a brain area, that's the happy brain area, that is electrically active. Rather, it's going to involve numerous brain areas, being active in concert and to different degrees. In the same way, that the keys on a piano, together, played in the appropriate sequence, represent a particular song. You would never say that one key on the piano represents that song, but that key is necessary. Similarly, in the brain, we can say that a brain area might be necessary, but not sufficient to give us a particular experience or generate a particular behavior. So when we think about goal seeking and the pursuit of goals of any kind in the brain, it doesn't matter what the goal is. It involves a common set of neural circuits and the neural circuit that I'd like to orient us toward today. And we will return to it a few times, involves learning a couple of names, but you don't have to worry so much about memorizing these. Just more important is to understand the logic of how it's put together and I will explain that and make it very clear. If you want to learn the names, that's great. One of the brain areas is the so-called, amygdala. The amygdala is most often associated with fear, so you might say, wow, how is that involved in goal directed behavior? Well, a lot of our goal directed behavior, is to avoid punishments, including things like embarrassment or financial ruin or things of that sort. And so the amygdala and some sense of anxiety or fear, is actually built in to the circuits that generate goal seeking and our motivation to pursuit goals. The other areas are the so-called, ventral striatum. The striatum is part of what's called, the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia, is a neural circuit, that can very simply be described as a neural circuit that helps us generate go, meaning the initiation of action and no-go, the prevention of action type scenarios. Let me make that even simpler. The ventral striatum is part of this thing called, the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia has sort of two circuits within it. One circuit is involved in getting us to do things, like I'm going to get up tomorrow and I'm going to run five miles first thing in the morning. I don't know if I'm actually going to do that, but I'm just using that as an example. Another circuit within the basal ganglia, is a no-go circuit, it's the one that says, no, I'm not going to go for the second cookie or the third cookie. I'm not going to eat that. And then the go circuit would be the one that's responsible for instead eating something else. Okay, so we have go and no-go circuits within the basal ganglia. So we've got amygdala, so what you think of as kind of fear and anxiety and avoidance. We've got, the basal ganglia, which are for initiating action and preventing action. And then there is the so-called, cortex. The cortex is the outer shell of the brain, and there are two sub regions of the cortex, that are involved in goal-directed behavior. One is the lateral prefrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex is involved in, so-called, executive function, things like planning. Thinking about things under different timescales, so not just what we want in the immediate term, but what we might want tomorrow or the next day and how our actions currently are going to relate, to the future. And the so-called, orbitofrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex has a large number of functions, but one of the key functions of the orbitofrontal cortex, it's involved in meshing some emotionality with our current state of progress and comparing that emotionality to where it might be, when we are closer to a goal. So, there are basically four areas, one involved in anxiety, one involved in emotion, one involved in planning and another involved in this go, no-go action. So that's a bunch of detail, but if I wanted to make it really simple for everyone, I would say there are four areas. One is an area associated with anxiety and fear, it's the amygdala. The second is involved in action and inaction, remember go, and no-go, so that's the basal ganglia. The other one is involved in planning and thinking across different timescales, so that's lateral prefrontal cortex. And then the fourth one, is involved in emotionality, where we sit emotionally present, compared to where we think we will be emotionally, when we reach some particular goal and that's the orbitofrontal cortex. Again, you don't need to know all those names. You don't need to know all the details, just understand that those different elements are involved in the decision-making processes that lead us toward particular goals and have us update our goal seeking, et cetera. One key thing is it doesn't matter what the goal is, the same circuits are involved. So whether or not you're trying to build a company, that's a billion dollar company that's going to go public, or you're thinking about planning a craft day at home with the kids or for yourself, or you're thinking about what movie to go see. Goals, goal seeking and assessing progress towards goals, all involve the exact same neural circuits. It's really remarkable. It's also very convenient for our discussion today. What's going on in these circuits, can basically be boiled down to two particular things. The first is, value information, trying to understand whether or not, something is really worth pursuing or not. So, placing a value on a particular goal. The other component of this neural circuit, is associated with action, which actions to take and which actions not to take, given the value of a particular goal in a given moments time. I want to say that again. The other component of the circuit is involved in action, whether or not you should act or should not act, based on your assessment of the value of a goal at a particular moment in time. And you're going to hear me say over and over again, in this episode, the value information about a goal is so key. Here's why, there is basically one neuro-transmitter or rather neuromodulator system, that governs our goal setting, goal assessment and goal pursuit. And that is the neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine is the common currency by which we assess our progress toward particular things of particular value. In fact, dopamine, is the way that we assess value of our pursuits. And so, as we take a moment and we shift our attention, to the psychology of goal setting. The things that you've probably heard a bit more about, about what sorts of goals are good and how to set goals and how to categorize goals. I want you to think about how dopamine, could possibly be involved in these different processes. And the reason I want you to do this, is that all of the psychology of goal setting and goal pursuit, is wonderful because it places things into different categories. It allows us to parse our thinking and organize our thinking. But what's not often seen, in fact, I'm not aware of any literature out there, scientific or literature in the popular press or in popular books, is an understanding of how the underlying neurobiology, can be layered on top of the psychology of goal setting, to allow us to set and pursue our goals more effectively. And that's what we're going to do today. We are eventually going to arrive at a set of four practices, that when performed on a regular basis, will allow you to assess, what is the value of this next particular action step? How worthwhile is it, to do behavior A versus behavior B in order to achieve a particular goal? If any of this is vague now, I'm going to make it all very clear for you. You're going to come away with some very specific lists of takeaways that you can put down on paper, if you like. And that you can use to set goals, assess goals, and execute goals more effectively, using the neuroscience of the circuits I just described and an understanding of the neuromodulator dopamine. Let's take a look at the psychology of goal setting and goal pursuit. This is an enormous literature, meaning there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of scientific papers about the topic of goal setting and goal pursuit. There's also a lot of information on the internet about goal pursuit. And in looking over this information, one comes to appreciate pretty quickly, that acronyms are a big thing. Acronyms, seem to dominate the area of goal setting, especially as it relates to things in the business sector, but also in the relationship sector. Now, acronyms are wonderful, they allow us to organize our thinking into less and conceptually they can be very useful. But as I moved through this literature, I started to see some redundant themes. And so what I've attempted to do, is distill out the redundant themes, that regardless of the person teaching or the scientific laboratory that happened to come up with these acronyms, that they boil down to some common features. So let's talk about that literature and I think we'll come away with an understanding of some basic elements that are common to all goals. Now, the modern science or the modern psychological science of trying to understand goal setting and pursuit, actually dates back to the 1930s. And we have to be sure that members of our species, were focused on goal setting and goal pursuit, long before the scientific literature emerged. It just stands to reason that, since the human brain hasn't evolved that much, we don't think, in the last 10,000 years, that people would be thinking about these things. They just didn't get them down into papers, that we could evaluate on PubMed and so forth, but now we can, so we can look at those papers. And what you find is that acronyms are abound in the psychology literature about goal setting and goal pursuit. So for instance, you'll hear about the work of Larkin Small, for instance, these are the last names of various researchers. The so-called, ABC method, that a goal should be achievable, it should be believable, and that the person be committed. It's sort of obvious once you hear about the ABC method. Then people came along and expanded on that, they talked about the so-called, SMART method. SMART being another acronym, that it be specific, that the goal be measurable, that the goal be attainable, that the goal be realistic and that it be time-bound, meaning that you set up certain period of time in which a given goal should be performed. And then people come along and modify these, this is the way that psychology research is done. I'm not laughing at it. I'm just chuckling because, it seems like the acronyms get longer and longer and longer. They developed the, SMARTER approach, adding an ER to the acronym, SMART, S-M-A-R-T-E-R. They added ethical and rewarding, which fortunately, are good things I believe, ethical and rewarding. What does all this mean? Well, what it means is that any kind of goal pursuit, any kind of goal setting, really has to involve a number of different states and neural circuits in the brain and body, at least that's how I view this literature. Why would I do that? Well, let's think about the very modern version of the kind of acronyms that I talked about a moment ago, dating back to the 1930s and extending into the 1990s. You can find beautiful talks online from people who have worked with some of the biggest companies and greatest high performers out there, to achieve incredible things. And they will talk about generating a sort of objective mindset for goal setting. They'll talk about goals needing to be significant. That it has to be a big goal. That it has to be concrete, so you have to be able to describe what the goal is. It has to be action-oriented, has to be inspirational, has to be time-bound. You have to have reasonable, realistic, verifiable measures. You have to constantly up the ante. If it's starting to sound repetitive, it's because it is repetitive. There are basically only three or four elements, to goal setting and goal pursuit. Basically, an individual or set of individuals, has to identify a specific thing that they're going to attain. In some communities, they talk about, knowing what right looks like, meaning being able to define a very specific goal. You can't just say, I want to be a champion athlete. You have to say what sport, and you have to understand what the path to that is. So any big goal of course, is broken up into a series of smaller goals, but the whole thing starts with thinking about the end in mind. And in a few minutes, we will talk about, whether or not visualization of the end in mind, is actually beneficial or detrimental to achieving goals. There's actually great neuroscience and psychology data on that now. So, I mentioned all these acronyms, not as an attempt to disparage them. I think they're wonderful. And I mentioned all that psychology literature, not in an attempt to disparage it, but rather just say that, goal setting is the first step, assessment of whether or not one is making progress towards those goals is the second but necessary step. And then there's the business of goal execution. And that brings us back to the neural circuit components, remember, this neural circuit, involving those four things earlier, the amygdala, striatum, orbitofrontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. They work together, to divide the whole process as I mentioned before, into two general categories. The first is, assessing value, knowing whether or not where one is at one given moment, relates to some external thing. Are things going well or things going poorly? And knowing how to gauge that accurately. And then, action steps, goes and no goes, do more of this, do less of that, do this, don't do that, et cetera. So, now we are going to shift back to the neuroscience and we're going to talk about the practical applications of the information I just described. Because I've given you a lot of kind of academic information. And as we do this, I'd like you to keep in mind, what are some things that you've either accomplished or that you'd like to accomplish going forward? Because as we do this, we can build toward a set of protocols, that at the end, you'll be able to very quickly plug in, your particular goals and a route to those particular goals, that's grounded in the science. That I think are going to be very effective in allowing you to reach those goals, more quickly and with indeed less effort. In fact, let's start with a tool now because as we move through all this information, I want to make sure that people are coming away with some practical things that they can implement. And indeed, some things that you can even do during the course of listening to or watching this podcast. The first thing to do, is to understand the difference between peripersonal space and extra personal space. Peripersonal space, is all the space, literally, that's within inside your body, the surface of your skin and in your immediate environment. Peripersonal space, is a key concept in neuroscience because you have particular neural circuits and particular chemicals, that are geared toward, what are called consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things and consuming things and enjoying things, that are in your immediate peripersonal space. Let me give you an example of this for myself, just to make it concrete. You can imagine similar examples for yourself right now. Within my current peripersonal space, is my interoception, my understanding or perception of my internal body. So, how quickly I'm breathing, my heart rate, the feelings on the surface of my skin, et cetera. But also, within the confines of my peripersonal space, is this coffee mug, that if you're listening to this, you can't see this, but I'm lifting up a coffee mug, I'm going to take a sip of coffee. That's a consummatory behavior, I have the coffee, I don't have to do much or motivate much to get it. I have other things here, pens and computer, et cetera. So things in your peripersonal space and consuming those things, is generally governed by a set of neurochemicals, that center around the neuromodulator serotonin. And there are a few others as well, things like oxytocin, but mainly serotonin. Contrast that, with the so-called, extra personal space. Extrapersonal space is everything beyond the confines of my reach. It would be something in the next room. It will be something down the street. It will be something at some other location, in space and time. And the neuromodulators and neurochemicals, that are associated with any kind of thinking about, anything in the extra personal space, are distinct from the neurochemicals and neuromodulators, that are involved in thinking about or making actions towards the peripersonal space. And the molecule that's most associated with thinking about or orienting toward the extra personal space, again, things beyond the confines of my skin or your skin, is dopamine. And this is a vitally important concept to understand, when you're setting goals and seeking goals. If we are to be good at goal seeking, if we are to be good at setting goals and assessing goals, if we are to achieve our goals, we have to be able to toggle back and forth between a clear understanding of our peripersonal space, what we have and how we feel in the immediate present. And our ability to understand what's out there in the extra personal space and our ability to move into that extra personal space. And a simple way to conceive of all this, is that we evaluate our progress in the peripersonal space. We evaluate how we feel, about some pursuit, even if we haven't initiated that pursuit yet. How we feel about a particular goal, is truly a feeling that we experience in the here and now, even though the goal is in the future. If we are going to evaluate whether or not, we made progress today or yesterday or not, that's an evaluation of how we feel in the immediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward any goal, involves orienting our thinking towards the extra personal space. And as we go through today's episode, I'm going to teach you a technique or rather a neuroscience-based tool, that will allow you to continually transition back and forth between the peripersonal space and the extra personal space in a way that will allow you to update and evaluate and better execute your goal seeking. The whole principle behind this, is that human beings, like other animals, have to make evaluations about whether or not they are on the right track. However, the important thing to understand, is that humans in particular can do this over different timescales. We don't just pursue food 'cause we are hungry, we pursue food, excuse me, for a particular meal, that we might be having with people tomorrow. We can modulate the timescale in a way that other animals don't. That's how we adjust our goal seeking, to different timescales. And in addition to that, humans are exquisitely good at biasing our behavior toward particular goals over very long periods of time. But there are a lot of mistakes out there, in fact, things that are outright wrong in the literature and in particular, in the internet, and then the kind of wellness and fitness and cognitive fitness space, that send people down the wrong path and those things we will talk about in a few minutes. But things like visualization, that visualization and visualization of this big goal, is the best way to achieve your goals. In fact, that's not the case, there's a much approach to doing all this. So now I'd like to shift gears towards talking about a few of the things, that most people get badly wrong in setting and assessing and executing goals. This is based on peer reviewed research, so I think it's very solid. I know it is very solid. And it runs counter to what many of us have been taught. Let's start with a simple one. We've all heard that multitasking is bad. We've heard multitasking is bad, it doesn't allow for focus. If you want to achieve anything, if you want to accomplish anything, you should not multitask. Well, it turns out, that's wrong. It turns out that there is a role for multitasking, but the multitasking has to be placed at a particular time within your goal seeking behavior in order to be effective. Really nice studies done at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Davis Lab, evaluated how long people are able to focus in different environments. How long they were able to stay concentrated on their work. And it turns out that number is exceedingly low. It turns out that most people, whether or not they're doing computer work or whether or not they're doing writing or accounting work or anything of that sort, can hold their attention for about three minutes at a time before they shift their attention off. And that's ridiculously low when you first hear it, but, that probably reflects a basic state of brain function. That hearkens back to a time when we were hunter gatherers, I doubt that we were maintaining focus solidly for hours and hours and hours, unless we were under some particular threat or in some particular crisis. Rather, you could imagine that people collected seeds and nuts and berries for about three minutes and then probably stood up, looked around and then kept going. Or that they were hunting animals or in some sort of pursuit, fishing, et cetera, and focused, focused, focused and every three minutes or so, they might've looked up and, you know, take a look at the sky or looked around to make sure that other people were there or not there, et cetera. It all stands to reason that that will be the case. Again, the neural circuits haven't evolved much. Now, multitasking, has been shown to have a very interesting physiological signature, when we multitask, when we jump back and forth between things, there is an increase in the level of the neurotransmitter, also sometimes called a neuromodulator, but basically same thing for sake of this discussion. There's an increase in the neurotransmitter epinephrine, which is adrenaline. And so, there are really nice studies now, pointing the fact that doing a bit of multitasking prior, to jumping into some focused, goal directed behavior, whether or not it's mental behavior or physical behavior, can actually be useful because it gets us into action. So we've all been told that multitasking is terrible, but if you, for instance, find yourself cleaning up your house and also checking your phone and doing a number of things, right at the point where you should be sitting down to write or do some focused work. It probably reflects some adaptive mechanism, where you use action and somewhat varied multitasking action in order to generate adrenaline in your system, because adrenaline just gets you in the action. Now, that's great, but, you don't want to multitask throughout any kind of goal seeking or goal pursuit behavior. Because, what's also very clear and we're going to talk about this in exquisite depth today, is that visual focus and in particular contracting your visual window, bringing the aperture of what you see, to a very fine point, can absolutely increase your clarity of goal seeking and the likelihood that you will pursue your goals. I've talked about this a little bit before on the podcast as a way of increasing focus for any kind of pursuit. I've talked about a practice, whereby you can literally look at a dot or a line, placed on a wall or on your computer in front of you for 30 to 60 seconds, and then moving into some dedicated work, where you need to focus. And indeed, just looking at a narrow piece of the visual world, a small piece of the visual world for some period of time and forcing yourself to hold that gaze on that location as best you can, can increase your level of cognitive attention and your ability to focus and stay focused. And this is not magic. It is the consequence of the fact, that most of your cognition follows your visual perception. For those of you that are low vision or no vision, meaning you're blind, or you have trouble seeing, my lab does a lot of work with people, who are low vision, no vision. They tend to use their auditory system, their hearing, as a way to anchor their attention to particular things. But most people out there can see and see pretty well and visual focus is the way to do that. Now, earlier, we were talking about this notion of peripersonal space versus extra personal space. And I'm just going to seed a little bit of the later conversation by saying, that when we focus on an external point. We are in a process of exteroception, is the focus on the extra personal space, not the peripersonal space. So when we focus on something, say a line on the wall for 30 to 60 seconds or at our computer for 30 to 60 seconds and just look at it and then move into any kind of action, whether or not it's work action or physical action. We are at its very core. We are engaging in this pursuit of extra personal space. We are placing our focus outside our body and therefore we are placing the brain into goal pursuit mode. Work at NYU, in particular, in the laboratory of a phenomenal researcher in their Psychology Department, by the name of Emily Balcetis, B-A-L-C-E-T-I-S. Emily Balcetis, has done really nice work on this. They've done is, they've had, people focus their visual attention on a goal line of some sort and then to engage in some sort of behavior, that requires a lot of effort. And they've done a lot of different experiments like this, but I'll just explain one. They always include a control group, where people have to go through the same physical effort or mental effort, but they don't focus their attention just on one location. The long and short of these studies is that, when people have to focus their attention on one location, like a goal line, they are much more effective in reaching those goals and they achieve them with the perception, that they expended less effort. I'll give you an example of one particularly nice study from the Balcetis Lab. So this particular study involves, physical exercise. Although, as I mentioned before, they've done similar studies looking at cognitive type work. And what they did is they had a group of people, exercise, wearing 15 pound ankle weights, and they had to basically move a certain distance or run a certain distance to reach a goal line. One group was focused on the goal line, visually focused, on the goal line. The other group was not told to visually focus on the goal line. And what they found, was that the group that focused on the goal line, was able to achieve reaching that goal with 17% less effort. They measured effort and they got there 23% quicker. That's a remarkable difference. So same distance traveled, with same workload because everyone's wearing the same 15 pound weights on their ankles. One group is simply looking at the goal line, the other group is not told to look at the goal line, simply by looking at the goal line, does something to the psychology and end physiology of these people, that allows them to move forward with less perceived effort and to do it more quickly. That's remarkable. And in this case, they're focused on the goal line, but in a few moments, we'll talk about how one can use updating of goal line, so incremental goal line. Starting with an intermediate goal, and then extending the goal line further and further. But just sit back for a second and think about that, just by changing where a person looks, they changed their perceived effort and their ability to do something, more effectively, more quickly, than a group that is not deliberately focusing their visual attention on one location. That's incredible. And it's so incredible, in fact, you might say, well, how could that possibly be? Well, it turns out, it has a very specific, underlying physiological reason and that has to do with changes in our so-called, autonomic nervous system. The aspects of our nervous system, that prepare us for readiness and action, or that prepare us for resting and relaxing. So what is special about focusing one's visual attention at a given location? Well, it turns out that we have two branches of our visual system. So visual information all comes in through our eyes, but then it can head down two different pathways. One pathway is engaged when our vision is brought to a common point, what we call, a vergence eye movement. So if we're focusing very intensely on a given point, regardless of how far away from us that point is, our visual system engages a certain set of neurons, neural circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail and that can evaluate small changes over small periods of time. Just think of it as a very detailed camera of the visual world. It tends to be very restricted. The other pathway through the visual system, is the so-called, magnocellular pathway. And this is a pathway that's involved in taking in global information about lots of things, that are happening around us. Movement of things to our right, movement of things to our left, things are happening down on the ground and all around us. And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will, of the neural circuits that are associated with alertness and attention. When you walk down the street and you're not thinking about much, provided you're not looking at your phone, you're not focusing on one location, you're more or less in a relaxed state, compared to when you're looking for a particular sign, you're looking for a bus or a train that's coming, or a particular person. And that should inherently make sense, when your level of attention and alertness goes up, there's sort of a small, but perceptible increase in your level of arousal. It's not really stress necessarily, but arousal of alertness. And it turns out that the visual system, accomplishes this increase in alertness by communicating with your circulatory system and the system that delivers blood and nutrients and oxygen to the rest of the tissues in your body. So let's talk for a second about what focusing our vision on a particular location does because in this study from the Balcetis Lab, what they found was, focusing on a goal line allows people, to move more effectively toward that goal. This is something you can leverage in all aspects of all goal pursuits. What happens when we focus on a particular location? Believe it or not, there's an increase in a particular feature of our blood pressure. Now your body has, of course, arteries, veins and capillaries, and your heart pumps blood, first to the arteries, and then to the other components of your vascular system. And we have so-called, blood pressure. Blood pressure is just how much, the fluid volume is pressing on those arteries, veins and capillaries. So you can imagine a pipe with very little fluid moving through it, that's low pressure. You have a pipe with a lot of fluid moving through it, that's even more pressure. You have a pipe with a lot of very viscous, meaning, very kind of sticky, thick stuff, moving forward, that's even more pressure. We have blood pressure and you've probably had your blood pressure measured. There's always two numbers. You have a top number, which is the systolic blood pressure. And then there's the bottom number, below the line, which is the diastolic pressure. So the important thing to understand, is that your blood pressure will rise when your heart beats, because there's more fluid moving through those pipes that are your arteries or veins and your capillaries. And that top number is called the systole or the systolic blood pressure, because that's the pressure at the time, when your heart contracts. So the top number, which normally, if you have a healthy blood pressure, is somewhere in the range of 90 to 120 millimeters of mercury. Millimeters of mercury is just the way, that pressure is measured. That top number, your systole, or your systolic blood pressure, is what's measured when the heart contracts. So, that's the amount of pressure when there's a heartbeat and it's moving through your vasculature. Now, between beats, the heartbeats, but then it relaxes, your blood pressure is going to drop to a lower value because fluid isn't being pumped through the system at those moments. And that's the bottom, the diastolic pressure. And typically for healthy people, that's going to be 60 to 80 millimeters of mercury. So you might hear about a normal blood pressure being about, again, this is an approximate, 120 over 80. What that means is, at the point where blood was being pumped through there, your arteries and veins, boom, that it's 120 millimeters of mercury, but then, when the heart relaxes for a second before the next beat, then it drops to 80. So there's high pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure. The fluid is being pumped through the system. Now, why am I telling you all this? Well, it turns out, that there are neural circuits that link your visual system and focusing on a particular point with that top number, the systolic blood pressure. And when you focus your eyes on a particular location, that systolic blood pressure goes up, and there are some other systems that are coordinated with it in your brain and body, that start releasing adrenaline, low amounts of adrenaline in most cases. And that adrenaline, further readies your body for action. So, bringing our visual focus to a particular location, does a number of things to the brain and the whole system of the body, to prepare it, to place it into a state of readiness that makes us more likely to lean into our goals into action. And if we step back and think about this, this makes perfect sense. The brain and body need to be coordinated. We can't just think about a goal. In fact, a deer or a lion, can't just think about a goal. It has to think about a goal and then has to feel some sort of activation energy, some willingness or desire to move forward in pursuit of that goal. So imagining a goal, has to be coupled to the physical pursuit of the goal. So our visual system in a beautiful way, brings together a focus, literally, a visual focus on a particular point outside us. Then it recruits an increase in systolic blood pressure, which creates a systemic, a body-wide and brain-wide increase in fuel utilization, in oxygen availability, in our willingness to move forward as a body, as a whole coherent system. And then there are also neurotransmitter systems, like epinephrine, as we will soon see dopamine, that get recruited as well to place us into a continual mode of action. This to me is a remarkable feature of our physiology and it gets right to the point of some of the psychological phenomenon that we were talking about earlier. Let's just recall what some of those are. I won't list them all, but, a goal has to be significant, they say. All the psychologists, all the popular stuff online says, it has to be significant, has to be inspirational and has to be action oriented. So let's say you look out into the landscape of what's available to you, whether or not it's just in your mind, or you look at a specific point, you say, I want to go to that particular restaurant, to eat that particular food. And you orient towards it and you move towards it. This is the way that your brain and body, are coordinating their actions together. Conversely, when our visual system, is in a mode of looking at everything. When the aperture of our visual system is very broad, we know that there's also a reduction in our goal directed behavior and a reduction in the systolic blood pressure. It's as if our peripersonal space is sufficient, we don't need to get beyond our current state. We're not oriented toward any one thing in particular. So I've now described some of the psychology and some of the underlying physiology. Now, I'd like to mesh this within the context of actual specific goal setting and goal pursuit. Because what many of you are probably thinking is, well, that's some physiology, there's some psychology, but how do you actually apply this towards setting and achieving goals? Well, you do that, by understanding that your mental frame and your attention are always either positioned, to your peripersonal space, focused on your immediate possessions and state, or towards things outside you. But then you also have the ability, to dynamically travel back and forth between those. And so next, we're going to talk about, what the literature says about things like visualization, immediate and intermediate goals, long-term goals and how to best achieve those. And then we're going to move specifically into the protocols that you can use. It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you, the listeners, in order to incorporate all the signs into a best practice, that you can do any time, any place, to really identify what it is specifically, that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal. Focusing our visual attention on one particular point, is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit. And if you'd like to read some of the scientific studies or read a review of the scientific studies, that have looked at how, narrowing one's visual attention, can really enhance the effectiveness of pursuing goals, I'll put a link to this study. The title of the study is, keeping the goal in sight, testing the influence of narrowed visual attention on physical activity. And this is a paper from Emily Balcetis's Lab, focuses mainly on physical activities, but it mentioned some other things as well. This is an article published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin in 2020, so it's recent. It's an exceptional paper in my opinion, really gets to the heart of how all this works and some of the examples of where it's been implemented. So let's apply this visual tool, in a very simple way, to any type of goal that you want to pursue. If you already know what goal you want to pursue, maybe it's a workout, maybe it's a cognitive work of some particular sort. Again, the process is very simple. You're going to focus your visual attention on one point beyond your peripersonal space, so it could be on your computer. It could be on the wall, it could be a horizon. It could be at a distance and you're going to focus your visual attention there. And with some effort you're going to hold your visual attention for 30 to 60 seconds, you might blink, that's okay, but you're going to try and hold your visual attention there. So no moving your head around. No diverting your attention to other locations. Some people will find it very easy to do. Other people will find it quite hard. Your mind may drift cognitively, that's okay, but try and bring your visual attention to that common point. Several episodes ago, I talked about how, there are actually studies looking at developing this kind of training in students, for ADHD and the data on that are actually quite encouraging. So for people who have ADHD and focus issues and attentional issues, this can be effective. For people who don't, this can also be effective. Again, it places your brain and body into a state of readiness and then the idea is to move into the particular actions, that bring you closer to your goal. We haven't yet talked about how to set goals and how to assess progress. This is simply how to pursue goals. But the visual component is important, in fact, I would argue that the visual system and harnessing your visual attention to a narrow point, is going to be the most effective way, to get your brain and body into a mode of action, to pursue whatever goal it is you're trying to pursue. That practice is in stark contrast to multitasking, where by definition your attention is moving from place to place to place. I mentioned that multitasking can be effective in getting your system into somewhat of an increased level of activation, so that you can pursue a more focused goal. But the visual attention to a particular point, is going to be the most effective way to bring your system into a state of readiness and action for goal pursuit. There's another really interesting way, that you can leverage your visual system toward long-term goals. The Balcetis Lab has also done, some really interesting experiments, looking at people's ability to set and stick to long-term goals. And the long-term goal that they looked at, was one related to saving money for later in life. This is something that a lot of people struggle with, a lot of people have a hard time investing money or saving money for later in life. Simply because as human beings, we vary in the extent to which we worry about what's going to happen later. There's also a phenomenon of so-called, delay discounting. Delay discounting, is the fact that goals, become less rewarding when they exist further out in the future. You may have experienced this walking past a donut shop. I love donuts I'm just going to admit it, over and over again on the spot. I love the smell of them. I love the taste of them. I try to eat them 'cause I'm told they're not that good for me and indeed, I don't think they are. I occasionally cave and I'll eat one or many. But in general, I try not to cave to the immediately rewarding properties of the smell and the taste of the donut. But, what we know is that if you smell a donut or you smell a wonderful piece of food, in the immediate term, it brings your level of focus, your mental focus to the immediate phase. And it feels very rewarding, like if you had it now, it would just be so good. But if you actually extend that reward out to tomorrow or the next thing you think, today happens to be a Saturday, that we're recording, but, on Tuesday morning, I'm going to get a donut. It doesn't have the same value because the reward system, doesn't work as well for long-term goals. It's not as salient. It's not as tangible, a goal, especially for something like a donut. Whereas the kinds of goals that work, when you place them out to the longer term and can create a heightened sense of motivation, tend to be things that are much more rewarding to us. So delay discounting simply says that, the further out in time that a given goal is, the less effective that reward will be in motivating one's behavior. And indeed you see this with saving money for retirement, you see this with all sorts of long-term investment, The Balcetis Lab, therefore did an experiment, where they looked at people's tendency to save money for later in life. But the groups that they created in this study, were really interesting. They had one group, imagine, what it would be like to be 30 or 40 years older. And then to invest a certain amount of money, according to whatever it is they thought that they would need. And they measured the amount that they had set aside and saved for later in life. The other group, actually viewed photos of themselves, so picture, images of themselves that were artificially, digitally aged, so that they could see themselves 30 or 40 years into the future. And it turns out that people in that second group, simply by perceiving their own image, in the future, invested far more money into later life. They set aside more money. Somehow it bridged the gap between their immediate experience of life and the longer arc toward what it was going to be like in 30 or 40 years. So very powerful result in my opinion, because what it says again, is that our visual perception of the future or our visual perception of the present, is what allows us to anchor our goal directed systems and our motivation to take on things that in the immediate term might not seem that useful. So, you can imagine all sorts of variations on this. You can imagine that every time I want a donut, I'd see a vision of myself or an actual physical picture of myself as a consequence of having eaten many donuts every day for the next 10 years. I don't know what that image would look like 'cause I've never seen it. That's not an experiment that I necessarily need to do because I'm not that motivated to eat donuts, but I have to confess, I am somebody who I think I'm pretty good at managing resources. But I think if I were to see an image of myself at 70 or 75, there's so many things that are associated with visual images. Like what our body must feel like, what our needs are probably going to be like in that state or in that age. What sorts of things we may or may not still be able to do at that age. And that anchors back to immediate goal-directed behaviors, such as setting aside money for retirement. Such as investing in one's health practices. And indeed there's a study that has looked at how people will invest in exercise and healthy eating. If they just think about the future and what they might be like in the future versus seeing images of themselves in the future, if they were to go down a healthy or unhealthy route. So again, the point is that the visual system, what we see, is principally important in defining what we do in the immediate term. Even if what we see relates to something in the far off distance. I think these are phenomenal studies and they get right down to an important issue that's been kicked around over and over in the literature and in the discussion about goal seeking, which is visualization. We here keep the big goal in mind, focus on the big goal. So now we're going to address, what does the science say about visualizing big goals? If you're somebody who's interested in business, or let's say you're focused on relationship, is thinking about the perfect relationship and what that would look like and the family that you would have and where you would live. Is that effective in generating the kinds of behaviors that will lead you to that? Is it effective to think about the big win at the end? Well, it turns out it is, but you have to be very, very careful with when and how you implement that visualization. 'Cause if you do it correctly, it can really serve your goal seeking well. And if you do it incorrectly, it can undermine the entire process. So, does visualization work? Well, turns out, that visualization of the big win, the end goal. So the Superbowl win or eight gold medals in the Olympics or graduation from the university of your choice or making a certain amount of money or finding the partner of your choice, et cetera. That visualization is effective in getting the goal pursuit process started, but it actually is a pretty lousy and maybe even counterproductive way of maintaining pursuit of that goal. Meaning continuing to engage the sort of actions that are going to get you to eventually achieve that goal. I think this is going to be surprising to people, at first, but if we think back to our discussion about the physiology of the blood pressure system, it'll make sense. Good scientific studies have been done where people are told to imagine, or even script out their long-term vision and goal for themselves. What is the big goal? And they're talked to, or told to imagine it with a rich amount of detail. To think about how it's going to feel in their body and the big win. And basically what happens is, if you measure people's blood pressure or other metrics of physiology, you see an increase in that systolic blood pressure. There's an kind of a ramping up of the readiness and excitement for that goal, but that increase in blood pressure quickly wanes. And over time, that visual of the long-term goal, becomes a poor thing to rely on in order to generate the actions that are required to reach that goal. In fact, there's a much better way to maintain ongoing action toward a goal that also involves visualization, but it turns out it's not about visualizing success. It's about visualizing failure. The Balcetis Lab and other labs have looked at whether or not people make progress toward goals of different types. Whether or not they're thinking about the goal. They're thinking about that goal line and what they want to achieve, that long-term goal and all the wonderful things associated with it, or whether or not they're thinking about all the ways in which they could fail, en route to that goal. This is not typically what we are encouraged to do. Typically, we are told don't imagine failure, push failure out of your mind, only focus on success. Fake it till you make it, or is a phrase that I absolutely hate, frankly, because it's not even clear what that means. And it's not even clear what the ethical form of that is. I think it means continue despite any anxiety or fear that things won't work out. But if you look at the literature, the scientific literature, what the Balcetis Lab and other labs have shown, is that there's a near doubling, near doubling in the probability of reaching one's goal, if you focus routinely on foreshadowing failure. You think about the ways in which things could fail, if you take action A or you take action B and instead, therefore, you take action C. You're supposed to think about how things could fail, if you don't get up and run each morning, if your goal is, say a fitness goal. So let's use that as an example, because even though I realized, people are in pursuit of many things, not just fitness. Fitness goals and physical goals are a very concrete thing that we can all get on the same page about 'cause they're related to actions. Let's say, somebody sets a goal of running five miles, four times a week, minimum, and as many as seven, four times a week, minimum before 8:00 AM. In a previous podcast on habits, I talked about the benefits of not necessarily setting specific times that one will do things, but setting time blocks that one we'll do things. So you say before 8:00 AM, you're going to run five miles and that's going to happen up to seven days a week. One version of this would be, okay, sit back in a chair and think about how great you're going to feel and look, if you're doing this every day. How your health is going to improve. How everything's going to be, your blood markers, of lipids, et cetera, are going to improve, okay, fine. That's the visualization goal of visualizing the end point. It turns out that is far less effective and maybe even counterproductive, compared to thinking about what's going to happen, if you don't do this. The negative health outcomes that are going to occur, the disappointment you're going to have in yourself. The fact that you're going to wait until 7.30, that's not long enough for many people to run five miles. You got to put on your shoes as there could be pouring rain or even hailing or snowing, outside. And now you're not going outside unless you're somebody who's particularly motivated to do that. So, foreshadowing failure turns out to be the best way to motivate toward goal pursuit. In fact, as I mentioned before, there's a near doubling in the likelihood that people will reach goals of any kind. When they're constantly thinking about how bad it's going to be, if they fail. If we think back to the neural circuit associated with assessing value in our goal pursuits, this makes perfect sense. The amygdala, that center of the brain that's involved in anxiety and fear and worry. Well, the amygdala, is one of the four core components of our goal setting and goal pursuit circuitry. And there's no bypassing that. there is no one listening to this or watching this who's amygdala is not involved in their goal setting and goal pursuit behavior. And so, while I'd love to be able to tell you that all you should think about is rainbows and puppies and all the wonderful, rewarding things that are going to happen when you achieve your goals. The truth is, you should be thinking mainly about how bad it's really going to get, if you don't do it. How disappointed in yourself, you're going to feel. How it will negatively impact you, if not in the immediate term, in the long-term, if indeed your goal is to reach your goal. So, I want to emphasize that I'm not interested in encouraging people to flagellate themselves. I'm encouraging people to achieve their goals. And it turns out the best way to do that, is by foreshadowing failure. And the more specific you can get by writing down or thinking about or talking about, how bad it will be if you don't achieve your goals, the more likely you are to achieve those goals. Part of the reason for that almost certainly has to do with increases in systolic blood pressure and increases in readiness in your system, when you imagine failure. The brain and body are much better at moving away from fearful things than towards things we want. I wish I could tell you that wasn't the case, but there is a true asymmetry in the way we are built. In fact, the brain and body can engage in what's called, one trial learning. When something bad happens, we eat a food that makes us sick. We have an interaction with a person or place that we really don't like. It only takes one trial to really... One event, one time to reorient or rewire our neural circuitry, so that we have a bias toward moving away from that thing in the future. When things go well, unfortunately, that doesn't often occur. If things go really, really well, it might orient our brain and body toward wanting more of that thing. And we'll have neural circuitry changes that will lead us to engage in that particular behavior or interaction again, but it is never as effective as these avoidance circuits. So again, foreshadow failure, if you're going to visualize in a positive way, do that at the very beginning of some goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every once in a while, you imagine the big win of scoring perfect on exam or winning the championship or the great relationship. But most of the time, if you want to be effective, you should be focusing on avoiding failure and you should be really clear about what those failures would look like and feel like. Now, let's talk about goal setting. Going back to that prominent literature, the psychology and popular literature, again, we can hear some of these themes start to emerge. The goal should be significant, we are told. It should be inspirational. It should be aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay, that's all fine and good, but let's get semi quantitative about this. Let's at least get biological about this. How inspirational does it need to be? Does it need to be the kind of thing that is so inspiring to me that I can't sleep at all? Well, that wouldn't be good because as I believe and I know, many of you have heard me say many, many times before, regular deep sleep, 80% or more of the nights that you go to sleep, is going to be crucial to your cognitive and mental functioning and your ability to achieve your goals in the long-term. That's absolutely clear. So, it's got to be, inspirational and exciting, but what does that really look like and what does that correspond to and how do we actually make that happen? Well, once again, there is a mismatch between what the real data show and what we're most often told. Turns out, that again, work in Balcetis Lab, but also other laboratories, has addressed whether or not the probability of achieving a goal, goes up or down, depending on whether or not one visualizes or sets a goal that is easy, moderate or impossible. An impossible goal would be, for instance, if I say, I'm going to jump from my front driveway, all the way up to the road, the road's, quite a distance away, it's more than 20 meters away. It's just not going to happen. It's not going to happen in this lifetime, it's not going to happen in any other lifetime. Not unless it involves some elaborate technology that I'm not aware of, a jet pack or something like that. It's just not going to happen. An easy goal would be something like, can you jump? Or could I jump, two feet in front of me, obviously, yes. Now I'm using a trivial example here, but this could be translated to any kind of goal, school goal, physical goal, et cetera. It turns out that, when people set goals, whether or not they are nutritional goals, eat more of this or eat less of that. Whether or not they're fitness goals, run more, lift more. Some other goals, swim less, swim more, whatever it is their goal happens to be. Some learning goal, some relationship goal, some attempt to modify their behavior. It turns out that if the goal is too easy, it's too within reach, it doesn't recruit enough of the autonomic nervous system to make pursuit of that goal, likely. Now that might be surprising, at least it was surprising to me, you think, well, something is really, really easy. there's a very low bar to achieve it. People are probably more likely to do it. But turns out that's not the case, when we hear that a goal needs to be inspirational, what do we mean? When we hear that something's too easy, to recruit our action, what do we mean? Well, Balcetis Lab measured, systolic blood pressure, and found that, when goals were too easy for people to attain, they didn't get that increase in systolic blood pressure and recruitment of the other neural and vascular systems, meaning the blood systems and the nervous system that would place them into ongoing effort. And so they quickly gave up. Also, if a goal was too lofty, if it was too far from their current abilities, it didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even if people could get very excited about something mentally, it simply didn't place their body into a state of readiness because it wasn't tangible that they could actually perhaps really achieve it. So it turns out that when goals were moderate, when they were just outside of one's immediate abilities or that one felt that yeah, that would take a lot of effort. But it's within range or maybe in range, like maybe I can do it, maybe I can't. Then there was a near doubling of the systolic blood pressure in the good sense. It didn't go into the unhealthy range and a doubling or more of the likelihood that they would engage in the ongoing pursuit of that particular goal. So here we're talking about goal setting., what we're saying is, set goals that are realistic, but that aren't so realistic, that they're easy. The goals need to be realistic and truly challenging. Don't set goals that are so challenging and so lofty that they crash that blood pressure system in the other direction and make you or anyone feel unmotivated. In hearing this, it makes sense, but I don't think I would have predicted it, had they not done this very controlled study. I would have thought, the loftier the goal, the bigger the goal, the more that it recruits the autonomic system and the more that people are likely, to lean into the energy and effort to pursue and attain that goal. I also would have thought that if a goal is really easy to achieve, that it would engage the systems of action in the brain and body enough that people would sort of get into motion and pursue that goal. But neither is the case. Again, set goals that are difficult to achieve, but that are not so lofty, that they collapse your system and that you feel overwhelmed. And the important thing here, is that how we perceive a goal, whether or not we think it's within reach or not, of course will vary, depending on whether or not we are rested. Depending on whether or not other aspects of our life are going well. I mean, we can think that we are hot on the heels of a lifetime goal and everything's going well, and then there'll be some crisis interpersonal crisis, or there'll be a health crisis and you'll be shut down. And then that goal seems very, very hard to attain. So we will talk about how to update goals under different context in a few minutes. But, of course this is going to be an averaging, this isn't something that you do just once. But the takeaway again is very simple, set goals that are moderately hard to hard, but not so hard nor so easy that they don't engage your brain and body properly. Moderate goals are best, if you want to achieve your goals. Now I'd like to talk about three particular areas of scientific study, that point to goal pursuit, goal assessment and goal achievement. Previously I told you, that it's great to foreshadow failure. That that's a great way to get your system into a state of activation. I also told you that you want to set goals, that are challenging but possible. And again, here, I'm paraphrasing from the work of Emily Balcetis. I want to be very clear. There are a few other things that one can do in order to bias the likelihood, that you will succeed in trying to achieve your goals. First of all, limit your options, trying to pursue too many goals at once, can definitely be counter productive. Now I realized that life is complicated. We all have multiple goals that we're trying to pursue, but if we have particular goals that are important to us, we have to be careful to not get distracted by other goals. And many people run into this problem. So setting one or two or maybe three major goals for a given year, is going to be more than enough for most people and is actually going to be challenging for most people. Now, of course we have daily goals and monthly goals and yearly goals, but if we have big lofty goals, we need to be careful not to contaminate our mental space and our visual space with too many goals. And why do I say visual goals? Well, what various department stores and supermarkets have discovered is that, the greater, the number of things in our visual attention, the more that we can draw our attention and our goals off a line of pursuit. What does that mean? Well, let's think about it in the practical context. This has actually been done. Big department stores have figured out that if they stock their shelves, chock-a-block with many, many options of food or clothing items or objects or anything like that, people simply buy more stuff. People are very prone to orienting their attention to whatever's in front of them. You put a lot of stuff in front of them, their attention drifts, you put fewer things in front of them, their attention is more narrow. In a later episode, we'll talk about designing a workspace, that's optimized on the basis of this. It doesn't mean being in a room with nothing except just your desk and a computer. Doesn't have to be that sparse, but visual sparseness, actually can help us orient our focus and our behavior. When we have a lot of things in our visual environment, or a lot of things in our cognitive environment. It's the same thing. And so if you're going to try and pursue a fitness goal, a relationship goal, an academic goal, and a longterm life financial goal all at once, that's four things. And you're going to have to come up with systems that allow you to isolate those goals in a very rigid way. And if you do have multiple interleaving goals and overlapping goals and simultaneous goals, in a few minutes, we're going to talk about a process that will allow you to use your visual system, to align towards each of those goals, sequentially, in a way that makes it much more likely that you'll achieve them. So now let's talk about specificity of goals. We've all heard that the more specific a goal is, and the more specific we are about when and how we are going to execute that goal, the higher probability that we will actually achieve that goal. And indeed that's the case, but there's an additional feature, that's not often discussed. That is vitally important. And in fact, maybe more important than having a specific time of day or a specific end point in mind. There's a really nice study, that was done looking at recycling. This is something that a number of groups, businesses, households, and individuals are trying to do more of. They're trying to lower carbon footprint or contribute to the world in some general way by throwing away fewer things that could potentially be recycled. So this has been studied in the context of the work environment, where a business decides and lets everybody know, that there's going to be a greater effort toward recycling cans or bottles or bottles and cans, et cetera. And then, the way these studies were done, is that the janitorial staff was swapped out temporarily for researchers that actually measured the number of recyclable items that showed up in the trash and not in the recycle, as a function of the total amount of trash. Why'd I say, as a function of the total amount of trash? What's a way of controlling for differences in beverage consumption from one week to the next? Anyway, the point is they were able to very carefully measure, how much people are recycling before and after this call to action to recycle more. And what they found was, if they said, we are going to try and recycle more, try not to put cans and bottles in the trash. There of course was an improvement in recycling, but it was pretty modest. Whereas when there was a very concrete plan and everyone knew what that concrete plan was, for instance, to place all bottles and cans into the recycle, not the trash or to limit the amount of trash by 50%, or to eliminate all recyclable items from the trash. So when they made it very concrete, exactly what the action steps were, there was a remarkable, I mean, close to a hundred fold or more improvement in recycling behavior that lasted many months after this call to action was made. The takeaway from this is quite straightforward. It means that having a concrete plan is essential. You can't just say, I'm going to become a better recycler or I'm going to do things that are better for the environment or I'm going to become more physically fit. It has to be a specific set of action steps that get right down to details about what success would look like. I've heard this before described as what does right look like? What is the actual outcome that one would like to achieve in terms of action steps? So not necessarily feeling states, it wasn't that they all sat around and said, how great we're all going to feel about ourselves in the world when we accomplish this goal? It was very concrete statements, very concrete plans about action steps that would deliver one to one's goal. Somewhat straightforward and intuitive, but nonetheless worthwhile. What it suggests is that for all of us, if we have certain goals that we want to achieve, we need to be exquisitely detailed about what the action steps are, that we are going to take and to constantly update those action steps, so that we have a higher probability of meeting those action steps. Some of you may be asking, how often should one assess progress? Well, that of course will depend on the given goal that you're trying to pursue. But in the studies that I've been referring to here, the assessment of progress and the updating of concrete plans was done weekly. So it seems like weekly is a good starting place, to address how well one performed in the previous week. And then based on that performance to update the action plan for the upcoming week. So weekly seems like a good solid rule of thumb for setting particular action goals and assessing one's progress towards the immediate and longer term goals. Any discussion about goals and goal pursuit, would be incomplete without a discussion about the molecule, dopamine. Dopamine is often thought of as the molecule of pleasure and reward, but actually it is the molecule of motivation. This is best illustrated by a classic set of studies, that have been carried out in both animals and in humans. The animal study can be described the following way, two rats, each in a separate cage. You can provide those rats with the opportunity to indulge in something that they like, like food or mating. Or heat, if it's cold in the environment, or a cool spot in the cage, if it's warm in the environment and so forth. And what you find is that, rats will very readily approach the rewarding thing. They will, mate. They will eat. They will pursue something that is of pleasure. Now, if you are to take one of those rats and deplete its dopamine neurons, you can eliminate it's dopamine neurons or block dopamine in the brain. What you find, is that those animals will still enjoy pleasure. They will consume the food, they will mate, et cetera. However, their motivation, to achieve pleasure is vastly reduced. In fact, if you place the item of pleasure, the mate, the food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away from that rat, the rat without dopamine will not even move one length of its own body in order to achieve that pleasure. And there are naturally occurring experiments in humans that mimic that result, very accurately. There are certain conditions in humans where there's a depletion of dopamine. And what you find is that, the depletion of dopamine does not inhibit an ability to experience pleasure, necessarily. It inhibits an ability to pursue or go through the series of action steps in order to achieve pleasure. So dopamine, really sits at the heart of our motivational state, to seek out goals and to seek pleasure. And this is true for immediate goals that take place within a timeframe of minutes or a timeframe of a day, or the timeframe of a week or the timeframe of a lifetime. Dopamine, is the common currency by which we pursue goals. Now, dopamine does a number of things that are very interesting. I'm going to describe a few of them as they relate to goal seeking behavior. First of all, there's a fundamental feature of how our brain releases and uses dopamine, that's called, reward prediction error. And the simplest way to think about dopamine reward prediction error, is that dopamine is released in the greatest amount and places us into a greater state of motivation, when something happens that's positive and novel. Now, an important thing to understand about dopamine, is that it's not always released on the same schedule. There are a couple of different ways that dopamine is released. And when it is released relative to your anticipation of a reward, is key. If you don't expect something positive to happen, you're just going about your day and something positive happens, dopamine and a lot of dopamine is released. I had this happen recently. I had no idea that I was going to be receiving something in the mail, but I went to the mail. I looked in the mail and I got something very positive. And I was really, really excited about this. This is a real event that happened, just today. However, if we anticipate something positive is going to happen and then that thing happens, we experience dopamine as part of the anticipation. So even before we get the reward, there's an increase in dopamine. It's not as high as it would be, if something really novel and unexpected and positive happened, but we do get an increase in dopamine. And then, when we actually experience the reward, we experience the positive thing, there's a smaller increase in dopamine. So again, the biggest increases in dopamine are response to things that are positive and unexpected. Lesser dopamine is released when we anticipate something good will happen and when that happens, yes, we get some dopamine. And we also get some dopamine when the positive thing happens, think about anticipating a great meal with friends. We have some dopamine churning, our friends come over, then we have the meal and we also get some dopamine from that, but not nearly as much as we would, if it had all happened as a part of a big surprise. Then, there's also the case in which we predict that something good will happen, when that happens, there's an increase in dopamine just as it was before, but then if that thing doesn't happen, for instance, our friends don't show up for dinner, then there's a drop in dopamine below our initial baseline. That drop in dopamine, is the chemical essence of what we call, disappointment. Now, this dopamine reward prediction error, as it's called, can be leveraged toward trying to reach our goals because it tells us where we should set our milestones. We can't be in a mode of simply being focused on the finish line. Very few people can do that over long periods of time in a way that's effective. Now, earlier I talked about a study where people were focused on a finish line visually, and they were moving through space with these ankle weights on, but that was a very short-term goal. So, if a goal is within minutes, or maybe even within an hour or as in with our immediate visuals environment, maybe we can do that. But most goals of the sort that most people are pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship goals, et cetera, involve some milestones. So, understanding what we know about reward prediction error, we can make better choices about where to place the milestones, how far out in the future to place milestones. So then the question becomes, how often or at what intervals should one assess progress? And it turns out this is very subjective, but that there's a way to make it objective. Now, in a previous episode of the \"Huberman Lab Podcast\", I had a discussion with the great Robert Sapolsky and we were talking about, how the brain can subjectively change whether or not a given behavior or experience, is positive or negative. And the example that Robert gave, is a really phenomenal one. It's a study that's been done in rats and also in humans where they took a rat and they had a rat run on a running wheel. Rats turns out like to run them running wheels and the blood pressure of that animal, the health metrics for that animal, the lipid profiles, many, many things improved. The rat was exercising and it got healthier and presumably happier, we don't know, we could've asked it, but we wouldn't know. It doesn't know how to tell us, but we can measure blood lipids. We can measure blood pressure and all sorts of things. And indeed, when that rat exercised or when people exercise, they generally get healthier. Except, in that particular experiment, they had another animal where every time rat number one, ran, rat number two was forced to run. It was on a running wheel and it was forced to run, not because it wanted to, but because it was forced to. And what was remarkable, is that the physiological effects of being forced to do something, were in the complete opposite direction as they were when those same behaviors were undertaken voluntarily. In other words, the rat that was choosing to run, got healthier and the rat that was forced to run became unhealthy, blood pressure went up in a direction that wasn't effective and useful. Blood lipids got worse. Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. And you see the same thing in humans. Now, what this says, is that our subjective understanding of why we are doing something, is fundamentally important for the effects that we will get from that behavior. And indeed the effects of that behavior will have on us. So this has two major implications. First of all, in terms of reward schedules, we can decide to use any reward schedule that we want for a given behavior. We can decide that the milestones for a... Let's say a plan of getting in really terrific cardiovascular shape over the next year. We can decide to assess every day and ask ourselves how good was our progress. And if we made progress, then we're going to reward ourselves. We could do that every third day. We could do it every week. We could do it every five minutes, if we actually had the time to do that. The reward schedule, the dopamine system, is highly susceptible to the subjective effects. These so-called, top-down effects of when we decide that something is going to be good for us, if we analyze it on a given timeframe, well, then it's going to be good for us. So, what I suggest people do is pick a particular interval at which they are going to assess progress. And if you've been making regular progress towards a goal that you reward yourself and the reward indeed is all cognitive. It's all mental. It's telling yourself, yes, I'm on the right track. Now, some people will say, wait, but I want to know exactly how often I should do that. You need to do that at an interval that you can maintain consistently. So you're not going to reward yourself every minute or every step of every jog that you take, unless you can do it, every minute of every step of every jog that you take. For that reason, I think that daily or ideally, weekly assessments are going to be best. I think that checking in at the end of a week, looking back on the previous week and assessing how well you performed in pursuit of a given goal. How many times a week you ran, or how many times you studied, or how many times you did something that you wanted to do or avoided something that you didn't want to do. I think that's a reasonable and tractable schedule to assess once a week. So that's one point, that pick a milestone that you can maintain consistently throughout the pursuit of a goal. The second thing, is that the subjective effects that were described by that Sapolsky study or that Sapolsky described rather, are absolutely essential for all aspects of goal seeking behavior. We cannot underestimate the extent to which the dopamine system and our sense of whether or not we are on the right track, is under our cognitive control. If we constantly place ourselves into a mode of thinking that we are failing, well, then indeed, we are not going to churn out much dopamine. Now, earlier, I said, we need to predict and visualize failure, but that is not the same thing as thinking about ourselves as failing. We need to predict what the outcome would be if we failed, but then encountering that and in behaving in a certain way, and thinking in a certain way, in pursuing our goals in an effective way. Maybe checking in on that each week, we definitely need to reward ourselves cognitively for the correct and successful pursuit. What this means is that anticipate and think about failure as a mechanism of generating motivation and indeed fear and anxiety, so that you lean into the correct behaviors and you lean away from the incorrect behaviors to reach your goal. But then weekly or so, whatever you can maintain consistently, you absolutely want to reward yourself cognitively by telling yourself, I'm on the right track. I got another week where I accomplish, whatever it is that I'm trying to accomplish. A concrete example that I'm following now, is this 150 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week, because that's shown to be very effective in improving mental and physical health metrics. So once a week, I'll check in with myself. If I reach that 150 to 200 minutes threshold, then I'll reward myself simply by checking off a box and saying, okay, I'm on track. I'm on track. I'm on track. This dopamine system is critical to re-up, to remind ourselves that we are on track, if indeed we are on track because dopamine itself provides a state of motivation and readiness to continue in the regular pursuit of our goals. Dopamine, the molecule, is actually used to manufacture epinephrine and norepinephrine. Which are other molecules in our brain and body, which put us into that readiness and action state. There are actually the molecules that help generate that increase in systolic blood pressure, that puts us into a state of readiness. So you can think about dopamine as a self amplifying system, provided that you are leveraging the dopamine system on a consistent schedule. Now, by also following a consistent schedule of self reward, you set yourself up for any positive unanticipated rewards, that may happen. So for instance, if you're checking in with yourself weekly, telling yourself that you're doing well, if indeed you are. And then out of nowhere, for instance, you're out on a run or you're doing something, I'm using fitness as an example. But you're doing something, you find yourself performing particularly well, that's a unexpected dopamine reward that will further amplify the system. Now I know many people out there, having heard me talk about dopamine before, worry, well, can I release too much dopamine and then the whole system will crash and then I'll run out of motivation? In general, that doesn't happen unless people are using pharmacology, supplements or prescription drugs or illicit drugs to increase dopamine. This is why I'm a big fan of things like, cold showers and cold water exposure, which has been shown to lead to long-lasting 2.5 X increases in dopamine, or in some cases, supplementation with things like L-Tyrosine, which are precursors to dopamine. Or in some cases, caffeine, which can increase the number of dopamine receptors that we have, so that whatever dopamine we have floating around can be more effective in activating these motivational states. But things that really increase dopamine and then cause it to crash, can be problematic. One way to conceive of dopamine, is as a sort of dopamine wave pool. You've probably seen these wave pools, where some pressure is pushed into the pool and then you get these waves going. If those waves are consistent enough, and they're are of high enough amplitude, the waves can continue to go up and down and up and down. But if it's a giant wave, if you get a huge blast of dopamine, well then a bunch of the water sloshes out of the wave pool and then you basically have to take some time off, reset that dopamine level. That's what happens in addiction and when people start pushing in a lot of drugs or other things into the system that increase dopamine too much. So today we've almost exclusively been talking about behavioral tools. It is possible to incorporate supplements and things of that sort, that can increase dopamine as a way to getting into ongoing motivational states. But I caution people about relying on those too much. Really what you want, is you want a situation where your own positive feedback, your own understanding, that you are reaching the milestones that you've set out for yourself. That you're achieving those, and that is what's causing these waves or these increases in dopamine that will further amplify your motivational states. Another very interesting aspect of dopamine that I've not talked about at all on this podcast before, is actually how the dopamine system interacts with the visual system. We've talked a lot about how harnessing your visual attention, to a particular point is great and can help serve your ability to both set and achieve goals. Really wonderful work that was done by Wolfram Schultz, who's one of the great pioneers in this area of dopamine and dopamine reward prediction error, showed that for people that have normal levels of dopamine, their visual search, meaning how they scanned visual environments, tends to be pretty constrained. They might move their eyes around a particular visual environment, searching somewhat. For people that lack dopamine, they actually have very little movement of their eyes. They don't actually tend to look very far into the horizon. They're don't have that very focused vergence point that we're talking about that kind of a... I guess for lack of a better phrase, that kind of eye of the tiger, focus on a goal. Rather, their eye movements are depleted and they're not actually evaluating horizons off in their future, they're not focused so much on the extrapersonal space. And this actually can be restored and some of these took place in Parkinson's patients and other people who have dopamine depleted, that when dopamine is restored pharmacologically, their visual focus is re-enhanced again. Now, there are a lot of details to this study that don't map perfectly onto everything that I've talked about. But the point is this, when we are focused on a particular point in visual space or a particular goal or horizon. All those systems, our blood pressure, epinephrine and indeed dopamine, get recruited to put us into a state of readiness and willingness to go pursue things in that extrapersonal space. When our visual attention is very diffuse, all of that relaxes, and we tend to be more comfortable staying in the place that we are, in our peripersonal space and the effect works in the other direction too. When dopamine is increased, our visual attention for particular things out in space, increase. So the way it works is reciprocal. When we use our visual system and in a particular way, bring it to a point of focus, it recruits chemical and neural systems in our brain and body that put us into a state of readiness and pursuit. And, when we increase certain chemicals in our brain and body, like epinephrine, like dopamine, then we also allow our visual system to be in a state of looking out at particular locations in our visual world. So the system works in both directions and some people leverage this by using things like caffeine or taking things like L-Tyrosine to increase dopamine. And again, it works both ways, there's no right or wrong way to do it. I'm a particular fan of using behavioral tools, always prior to using supplementation or any kinds of other tools because behavioral tools have a very unique feature that supplementation and other chemical tools don't. Which is that behavioral tools used over time, engage neuroplasticity. As we start to practice, using our visual system to harness our attention to particular locations and in that way, move to our particular goals, we get better and better at using those systems. In fact, the systems for focus and motivation, themselves have plasticity, so we get better at being motivated and focused when we place our visual attention at a given location. Using chemical assistance of a safe kind, of course, check with your doctor. But things like L-Tyrosine or caffeine or those combined, yes, it will increase dopamine and will increase our ability, to engage in visual focus somewhat. But those compounds alone, don't modify the circuitry in the way that we want. So I always say, behavioral tools first, then nutritional tools, then supplementation tools and then if it's right for you and safe, maybe you advance into some of the other more sophisticated tools. I'd like to just briefly recap what I've covered up until now. And again, emphasize that much of what I've covered has been based on the beautiful work of Emily Balcetis and colleagues. I do hope to get her as a guest on the podcast, by the way. First of all, set goals that are challenging, but possible, those moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult. But moderately challenging goals, seem to be the most effective in moving people towards their goals over the short and longterm. Second, plan concretely, you need a concrete set of actions that you're going to follow in order to reach your goals. Third, foreshadow failure. This is a somewhat surprising one to me. I would have anticipated, that imagining success is the way to go. It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success, can be useful at the outset of a goal and maybe every once in a while in pursuit of that goal. But that it's not terrific for putting you in constant pursuit of that goal, rather, foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure and all the terrible things that it's going to bring, seems to be more effective. And that maps very well to what's known about the neural circuitry and the involvement of the amygdala. Focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors. Removing distractors and getting your body and brain into a mode of activation. Getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure, that puts you into forward motion towards your goals, is absolutely key. So that's a brief summary of what I've covered up until now. There were other things too, of course, the dopamine system and the power of subjective top-down control in regulating that dopamine system. But I want to be sure to include a tool, that's been especially powerful for me, that's grounded in the neuroscience research and in the psychology research. And as I describe this tool next, I think you'll see the ways in which it measures nicely with the work that Emily Balcetis and colleagues have done. This is something that, I've personally been doing for many years, based on my understanding of the visual system and the understanding that indeed we can move our cognition and our perception from a place of interoception and focusing on our peripersonal space. That space within us and immediately around us and on the things that are immediately accessible to us. That we can shift from that mode to this mode of exteroception of focusing on things outside the confines of our skin and that are beyond our reach, that are literally goal directed behaviors and goal directed thoughts. And this is something that in the past, I have talked about a little bit and I've talked about something called, space-time bridging. And we haven't talked too much about the time domain of the visual system today. But space-time bridging, is simply a way of using one's visual system to focus on the peripersonal space and interoception. And then gradually in a deliberate way, stepping one's focus into the extra personal space and then back to the peripersonal space in a way that gives you a lot of flexibility and control over that ability in your daily life. So, I'm going to first describe the tool, and then I will explain more about the underlying science and the underlying mechanism. Here's how you would do this. You could do this indoors or outdoors, although, ideally, you would do it in a location where you could view a horizon. It could be through a window or ideally outdoors, without a window. It could be done anytime of day. At night, it might be a little more challenging, but it goes the following way. What you first do, is you would close your eyes, this could be done sitting or standing. But you would close your eyes and you would focus as much of your attention, including your visual attention on your inner landscape, on your interoception. So that would be your breathing, your heart rate, maybe even the surface of your skin, but really focusing internally. Now, how can you focus your visual attention internally, if your eyes are closed? Well, you do that by imagining your inner landscape. So you don't have to imagine your heart beating and so forth. But what you're trying to do is eliminate perception of the outside world. You're eliminating exteroception and you're focusing all of your cognitive attention and your perceptual attention on what you're experiencing within the confines of your skin or at the level of the surface of your skin and inside your body. And you would do that for a duration of approximately three slow breaths. So close your eyes. You do breath one, breath two and breath three, concentrating all your attention on your internal landscape. Then you would open your eyes and you would focus your visual attention on some area on the surface of your body. So for me, the way that I typically do this, will be to focus on, say the palm of my hand. So I'll focus my visual attention on the palm of my hand. And I then do three breaths again, focusing on my internal state, but now I'm splitting out a little bit of my attention from interoception to exteroception. I'm focusing on something outside me, the ratio or the split of attention is about 90, 10, about 90% of my attention is focused internally, but I'm also focusing some of my attention externally. Most people can do this pretty easily. Then, there's a third, what I call, station. I now move my visual attention to outside my body, to some location in the room, or if I'm outside in the external environment, something in the range of five to 15 feet away. And I'm trying to move 90% of my attention to that external object. So now I'm really biasing my perception and my attention towards exteroception. As I breathe, I'm paying attention to those three breaths, so that's why there's still 10%, that's focused on my internal landscape because I want to pay attention to those three breasts. But I'm focusing as much of my attention, outside of myself, maintaining just a little bit on my internal state, so I can measure the cadence of those three breaths. Then I move my visual attention to yet another station, which is further away, typically, a horizon or something as far off in the distance, as I can possibly see. Again for the duration of three breaths. And at that point, I'm trying my very best to move 99, if not 100% of my attention to that external location. And then, what I typically will do, is I will try and expand both my vision and my cognition to a much broader sphere. This is that, magnocellular vision that we talked about before, where I'm not focusing on a particular location on the horizon. I'm trying to dilate the aperture of my field of view, so I can see as much of the visual landscape as I'm in as possible. If you're in an internal, excuse me, if you're in indoors, then that might be the ceiling, the walls and the floor of the environment you're in. If you're outdoors, it would be to expand your visual focus as broadly as you possibly can. Again, for the duration of three breaths, then I would return immediately to my internal landscape. I would close my eyes and I would do three more breasts focusing entirely on my interoception, on my internal landscape or what we called before, my peripersonal space. And I would then repeat that, peripersonal space, 100%, focus on my hand, 90%, 10% on my peripersonal space or my internal landscape. Stepping out to another location where it's mostly exteroception, maybe a little bit of recognition of my internal state, then to the horizon, then to this broader visual sphere, then back into my body. And I would work through each of those stations, maybe two or three times. The entire thing takes about 90 seconds to three minutes, depending on how many breaths you do. I said three, but you could do one or 10. It doesn't really matter. Or, it's also going to depend on, for instance, how slowly your breathing. 'Cause your breathing might be faster than mine or vice versa. What is all of this doing? Why do I call this space-time bridging? And why is this useful for goal setting? The reason I call it space-time bridging, is that the visual system, is not just about analyzing space. It's actually how we batch time. It's how we carve up time. And the simple way to state this is that, when we focus our visual attention on a very narrow point, that's close to our body and our immediate experience. We tend to slice up time, very finely. We're focused on our breathing. We're focused on our heartbeats. In fact, our breathing and our internal landscape and our heartbeats become the sort of seconds hand, if you will on our experience. We are carving up time, according to our immediate physiological experience. Whereas when we focus our visual attention outside our body, not only do we engage that exteroceptive, extra personal space system, and we start to engage the dopamine system, the goal-directed system, but we also start batching time differently. When we focus our visual system into a broader sphere of space or into a space beyond the confines of our skin, we start carving up time, our frame rate changes. Now this is useful in the context of goal setting, goal assessment and goal pursuit. Because with the exception of a very few isolated examples, almost all goals, involve setting some goal, that's off in the future, and then carving up the time between now and the achievement of that goal into milestones, that range in duration. And the rewards, even if we try and just make them every week, are going to come at some unexpected intervals and that's actually can be helpful for reinforcing behavior, intermittent reward. That's intermittent and random is the most effective reward schedule we know, but the problem is always, how do we keep our cognition in line with the long-term goal while also being focused on these more immediate goals? And so this particular practice, that I call space-time bridging, but we could give it a different name. I'm sure there are better names. Maybe you can suggest some in the comment section on YouTube, that are more accurate or map to it better. But this behavior or this practice rather, is teaching us to use our visual system and thereby our cognitive system and thereby our reward systems, to orient to different locations in space and therefore different locations in time. And that is the essence of goal directed behavior. That is the essence of setting a goal. It's about thinking about what you want. Then it's about setting milestones that are intermediate to that goal. Then it's about assessing whether or not you're reaching those milestones. And then, it's of course about updating your goals, if you need to update your goals. All of that is an enormously confusing batch of challenges, if you think about it all at once, but if you break it down into these elements, that the visual system can help you find and move towards those milestones. I think there's ample evidence to support that and that your control over your visual system, is indeed yours, that you can deliberately set it to different locations. And then you make a practice of stepping through these different stations on a regular basis. Again, I do this each morning. I do this once a day. Rarely have I done it twice a day. Rarely have I missed a day. But by doing that, you can be very effective in teaching the systems of your brain that are related to goal setting and reward, to map to different timeframes. So, I found this to be a very effective protocol, the Balcetis work has mainly focused on visual tools that are of a single horizon. Here I'm talking about multiple what I called stations or horizons. But what's very clear, is that an ability to move from different visual stations and to do that in a deliberate way in a focused and conscious way. Clearly maps to an ability, to conceive of different goals over different periods of time. And I do believe can be greatly beneficial in allowing one to set particular goals and then move through the milestones to those goals and to constantly update one's pursuit and reward in reaching those milestones and eventually, the overall goal. Per usual, I covered a lot of material today. We talked about some of the neuroscience and psychology and popular understanding of goal seeking behavior. How to assess goals, et cetera. Talked about the beautiful work of Emily Balcetis at New York University and her work on the use of the visual system, to better achieve goals. And indeed things like visualization and why forecasting failure can be more effective than forecasting success as counter intuitive as that might seem. That's what the data point to. And we talked about the importance of setting concrete plans and really what that means. And what intervals at which to assess progress. And what intervals at which to assess reward and how the dopamine system is involved. And in addition, I described this practice that one can incorporate as a daily or semi-daily practice of so-called, space-time bridging of using the visual system and your ability to deliberately step your visual system from stations that are within your body. So-called peripersonal or interoceptive space out into the world further and further. And then back again in sequence as a way to harness and cultivate and build up these systems that link vision, space, time, reward systems and so forth. Ultimately, as you set out to accomplish your goals, there are going to be a number of basic steps that everyone will have to follow. You have to clearly identify, what the long arching ultimate goal is. You have to identify what the milestones will be. You might not know all of them at the outset, but you ought to have some idea about the intervals at which you are going to set those milestones and set your reward schedule for assessing progress in route to those milestones in your ultimate goal. My hope is that you'll be able to incorporate these tools, if not all of them, perhaps just one of them or two of them in pursuit of whatever particular goals, you happen to be focused on at this point and in the future.

    "summary": "Setting and achieving goals, is not a uniquely human endeavor. Another thing that's really unique about the human brain, is that we are able to have multiple goals interacting at once. So, for instance, we probably all have fitness goals, goals in relationships of different kinds, friendships, and romantic partnerships as well as maybe scholastic goals. And actually one of the major challenges in pursuing goals, is that goal pursuit often interacts, meaning if you can spend 100% of your time chasing one particular goal, that might be very effective for that goal, but then we tend to fall back on some of our other goals. And so we have to juggle both our goal setting and our goal pursuits. Well, it turns out, it's a neural circuit. Rather, it's going to involve numerous brain areas, being active in concert and to different degrees. So when we think about goal seeking and the pursuit of goals of any kind in the brain, it doesn't matter what the goal is. It involves a common set of neural circuits and the neural circuit that I'd like to orient us toward today. The ventral striatum is part of this thing called, the basal ganglia.\nIn this episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss the science of goal setting and achieving goals. We discuss the importance of setting challenging goals, planning for failure, and using the visual system to harness attention and motivation. We also discuss the role of dopamine in goal pursuit and how to incorporate supplements and other tools to increase dopamine. We also discuss the importance of using behavioral tools, such as setting goals and making concrete plans, before using supplements or other tools. We also discuss the importance of visualizing failure and how to use the visual system to bridge space and time. We also discuss how to incorporate these tools into a daily or semi-daily practice to harness the power of the visual system to achieve goals.\n",

    "rawText": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] Recently the Huberman Lab podcast hosted a live event at The Wiltern theater in Los Angeles. It was entitled The Brain Body Contract. The first part of the evening was a lecture about science and science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. The second half was a question and answer period, in which the audience asked me questions from the podcast, or related to their own interests or things that they've gleaned from social media, or just general questions about mental health, physical health, and performance. And I answered those questions for them. We wanted to make the recorded version of that question and answer session available to everybody, regardless of who could attend. So what follows is the question and answer period from The Wiltern theater Brain Body Contract live Huberman Lab event. I want to be sure to thank the sponsors from that event. They were Eight Sleep, which makes smart mattress covers with heating and cooling capacity. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago, and it is completely transformed by Sleep. I sleep so much deeper, I wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all. And I wake up feeling far better than I ever have even after the same amount of sleep. In fact, I love my Eight Sleep so much that when I travel, now I'm quite bothered that Airbnbs and hotels don't have Eight Sleep mattress covers on them. And I've even shipped my Eight Sleep mattress cover out to meet me in the location that I arrived to so that I get the best possible sleep. If you want to try Eight Sleep, go to eightsleep.com/huberman to save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit holiday bundle, which includes their new Pod 3 Cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman. I'd like to also thank our supplement partner, Momentous. They make the very highest quality supplements. They ship internationally, and they've formulated supplements as single ingredient formulations that match what is discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast. If you're interested in any of those supplements, please go to livemomentous.com/huberman. And now without further ado, the question and answer period from the Huberman Lab live event in Los Angeles. [MUSIC PLAYING] What occurs in the mind body when you have ADHD? Are there ways to address it without medication? Thank you for this question. So attention deficit hyperactivity disorder used to be called ADD. The hyperactivity part is a little misleading. And again I'm not a clinician here. Here's what we know works for some people, and yet there are always going to be side effects of any kind of chemical manipulation, which is that, we know that people, kids, and adults with ADHD actually have a tremendous capacity to focus if they like what they're focusing on. You take a kid with ADHD who can't focus and you give them their favorite video game and they are a laser. The threshold to access the dopamine system is higher. And dopamine has this incredible ability to focus the brain and other aspects of the nervous system. Certainly, if people require medication, I'm not going to tell you to stop taking that medication. But the focus training exercises that have been explored mainly in China, but they're starting to be explored over here as well, do seem to be of benefit. And these are as they sound. They use them in schools in China now, which are literally visual focus exercises. Your mental focus, that is your ability to focus on things cognitively, follows your visual focus. And of course your stress will anchor your-- essentially put you in a soda straw view of the world. So yes, there are non medication-based treatments. By medication I'm assuming you mean prescription medication. There are of course supplement-based medications that will increase dopamine mainly L-tyrosine. Again, this is something to think carefully about before you start tampering with your dopamine system. But it is the-- L-tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine. So it will raise your dopamine levels. But I believe, and you'll hear me say this as many times as necessary, that one should-- if you can rely on behavioral tools first, then of course, sleep and nutritionists are prerequisite. Again, for all mental health, physical health performance, you simply can't neglect those. And then and only then if all of that isn't working to rely on supplement-based tools or on prescription medication. So it's clear that Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, et cetera work for ADHD, but some people choose to rely on more subtle forms of pharmacologic manipulation like L-tyrosine. And this focusing exercise essentially consists of spending 1 to 3 minutes trying to maintain visual focus. And yes, you are allowed to blink. I don't know why we tend to stare at something we don't blink. But don't let your eyes dry out. And that can increase your ability to focus cognitively. And it works. And keep in mind that focusing always involves a refocusing. We covered a beautiful data set, not collected by my lab but by Wendy Suzuki's Lab at NYU, that at roughly 10-minute, it's actually 13-minute a day meditation of the sort, where you just focus on your breathing, has been shown to improve focus significantly. Why don't we hear about this more? Well she's now Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU and all the students are hearing about it. Hopefully, they're doing it. But it takes a little bit of discipline for some reason 10-minute a day type meditation is something that very few people follow consistently. But if you're looking for non medication-based treatments for ADHD, or you're somebody who just struggles with focus, the focusing exercise or the meditation, I just subscribed it can be very useful, so say the data. Yeah, thanks for bringing up space-time bridging. Are people familiar with what space-time bridging is? I haven't talked a lot about it. OK, this is-- thanks for bringing that up. We actually have an episode on meditation coming up soon where I cover it. And I talked about it long ago and then I kind of abandoned it because well, we wanted more data and it's a pretty interesting technique. If you think about the nervous system and vision in particular, but if you're not a sighted person or you're low vision, or no vision, you could do this with your hearing. But I'm going to assume most people here are sighted. If not just translate this to the auditory system. You have this incredible ability to close your eyes and focus, for instance, on-- people talk about the third eye center, focusing right behind your forehead. Do you know why people do that when they meditate? The reason is that you actually have no sensation in your brain. It's the one place to focus your attention for which you abandon sensation. If I think about any portion of my body or my breathing, either I'm going to sense what's happening. I'm going to perceive my inner landscape, so-called interior reception, or my outer. If I look out into the world, it's external perception. When you focus your attention with your eyes closed, you do have to close your eyes just behind your forehead. You are focusing on your thinking Sort of obvious, but I don't-- at least to me it never been stated that clearly. Again, one of the problems with some of the more traditional practices but also the problem with science, is that there's a shrouding of everything in very complex language, which sucks. Why is it suck? Because it's a separator. You eliminate the number of people that can be brought to potentially useful practices. And I don't like it when people, including myself, overuse mechanism and descriptions of fancy phrases to mask basic principles, so simplest language I think it tends to unify people around the practices. So when you focus on this so-called third eye center, or a spot right behind your forehead or on your breath-- it's a little tricky with the breath, but when you focus on your frontal cortex, there's nothing to sense. Because there's no sensory neurons there. There's no touch. There's no pain. Nothing. That's why in these gory movies, you can take the skull off and-- while in neurosurgeries they're poking around in there, and the person's playing a violin. Like no anesthetic No anesthetic. Doesn't require anesthetic. There's no sensory neurons. You can't sense anything there. So space-time bridging involves-- it's essentially a meditation, but it's really a perceptual exercise. I think that's where we're going with this, is it starts by closing your eyes and focusing on that location for which there is no sensation. There's only thought. And then opening your eyes and focusing on a location maybe about the distance of your hand. And you focus also on your breathing. So you sort of imagine a kind of a tether between that. You can split your attention to these two locations. You're thinking about your body and you're thinking about a location outside of you. And then while continuing to think about your body, so-called intersection, focus on your breathing, you focus further out, and then further out, and then further out. And then ultimately, you know that little cartoon or meme where they're like, we're just a little blue dot floating in a big universe. And like it's supposed to make all your problems go away. It kind of works because what you've done is you've expanded your perception, and you go oh, yeah the stuff that's happening in here is really important when I'm focused on what's happening in here. But when I'm focused on what's going on and the vastness of all this, and we're just a little pale blue dot and all that, it changes your perception. Not just your visual perception obviously. Changing your visual perception changes your cognitive perception, which changes your emotional experience. So the space-time bridging is a perceptual exercise where you step from focusing internally to focusing externally at a short distance, then a further distance, further distance, further distance, and then trying to imagine yourself in this larger landscape. It sounds very mystical but it's actually very neurobiological. And it captures something really amazing. Why is the T in there-- the time? Space-time bridging, because this is space? But time is in there because when you focus in close, your slicing of time is finer. You notice the subtle fluctuations in your breathing and things that are happening up close. Whereas when you focus further out, your perception of time actually changes, which is why in panoramic vision we are calm. And when you think about, we're just a pale blue dot and we mostly only live to about 85 or maybe 100 years old, and then what's happening right now, my boss being a jerk, and all that doesn't really matter because the Earth is spinning and all that kind of stuff. Which is all true. And it's the stuff of philosophy and mindfulness. And I think it's beautiful. What you're really doing is you're changing your time perception by changing your space perception. So space-time bridging is very useful because most people get locked at one step, one of these stations, especially under conditions of stress. And people who have trouble focusing-- and I'm glad you brought this up in this context of ADHD, people have a hard time focusing whether or not they have ADHD or not, tend to skip back and forth between different space-time domains, as we call them in science. So this is a simple exercise that you can do. Focusing internally then stepping out externally, and then stepping back in. All the while paying attention to your inner landscape just simply by focusing on your breathing. It's a tool that we're still collecting data on in terms of its utility, but people are already using it. And I don't think of it as a meditation. I think of it as a perceptual exercise. Thanks for asking that. As a teenager what are five things you would recommend to physically feel my best? I'm a 15-year-old surfer who attends high school and plays soccer. It sounds like you're doing a lot of things, right? To physically feel your best. So I'm going to grasp at some context here that I'm not-- that's not within reach. I'm assuming if you are doing all these things you're hopefully doing a bunch of other things too. And they're going to be demands on you that you probably some of them you don't want to do, school and things like that, are going to have varying levels of joy and delight and demand of things you don't want to do. I don't want to default always to the simplest of tools. But I certainly think that even as a 15-year-old if you're not already getting lots and lots of sleep, that's going to be great. Tell your parents that I said you should get lots and lots of sleep. provided you're not sleeping through classes, I'm a professor after all. I couldn't tell you otherwise. I would say if I could travel back in time as a 15-year-old, I would encourage you to cultivate some sort of mindfulness practice. I know this sounds a little cliche, but having some awareness of your thinking about your thinking is good. But I'm actually not going to say sit down and meditate for 10 minutes a day, or do NSDR. I'm actually not going to tell you that I think given how plastic your brain is, how much it's changing at 15, I would encourage you-- and maybe you would set a timer for this, to actually develop just a really keen awareness of what stresses you out, what relaxes you, what delights, you et cetera. And just to simply develop an awareness of that, because those are your antennae. And I certainly had a meditation practice as a youth, mostly given to me, because I was a little haywire and I needed it. And it worked pretty well. But I think in retrospect, what I wish I had developed was more of a sense of how I navigated stress or things and things I enjoyed and things I didn't enjoy. And I would just encourage you to have a general awareness. Try and detect and learn about what raises your adrenaline, what raises your dopamine, what raises your serotonin, and then start thinking about tools. But, again the awareness is going to be very valuable and gosh, as a 15-year-old you are in this amazing blessed period of heightened neuroplasticity, should we all be so lucky. So enjoy it. Next question please. Clarity on adrenaline regarding cold water. Should we wait to feel the rise of adrenaline, the \"get me out of here\" feeling and the fall of it before bailing? Yes, provided it doesn't kill you. I don't want to say cold water. It's hard to kill yourself with cold water, provide your head's above and you're breathing. But it's-- sorry, my podcast producer's always like, \"I can't help that.\" Anyway, it's a great tool. And different days it'll feel different. So for instance, doing any kind of adrenaline and deliberate cold exposure, or adrenaline increasing activity early in the day, you might find that you are more \"resilient\" than later. In other words, the wall like, I really don't want to do this. This is actually interesting for I think it extends beyond cold water. Let's say you really don't want to do something. Pay attention to the fact that maybe it's not the right thing to do. But assuming it's something that you know you should do but you don't want to do, you are already in the first wall of adrenaline. You don't experience it necessarily as heightened levels of stress. You might experience it as heightened levels of fatigue or a hard time shifting on that kind of activation state that's required to move through the thing. But I do encourage you to take advantage of that. And we have an episode coming out tomorrow actually that answers questions like, should you train if you're sick and what if you travelling. And there's context always. But I think that you do want to experience. If you want to get the most out of the cold water exposure and to be more specific the adrenaline, then you want to get to that point of I really want to get out of here, but I know I can stay in safely. But I really want to get out of here. And it's a little hard to explain, but there's just so much learning in those short moments about where your mind goes. And this sounds very kind of again, subjective and maybe a little wishy-washy. But you can realize great things about yourself in those moments. You can find insight in those moments. Also keep in mind that the degree of discomfort, not just physical but mental discomfort, is directly predictive of the pain to pleasure wave that you'll experience afterwards. The reason it feels so good when you get out of the ice bath and you're showered off-- I always do the warm shower after. I don't do this end on cold thing. I don't know, It just seems a little too painful. And then take a warm shower and then you feel great. And that's the surge of dopamine that we know based on a paper published in the European Journal of physiology lasts many hours, and it's a 100% to 200% increase in dopamine. It's not a subtle effect. And then people say, wait, is that dopamine going to crash my dopamine system? No, because it's a nice slow rise. In fact, I am actually not aware of many things besides love and delight that can create this long, slow arc of dopamine lasting many hours. Maybe you're aware of other things. If you are, let me know. But it turns out that long arc is a true anti depressant. And my colleague at Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke who's the head of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic has talked about in her amazing book Dopamine Nation about patients of hers that have really helped themselves along and out of the more depressive phases of working through addiction and in just depression in general through directed cold water therapy. So I'm obviously a fanatic about it in the sense that it's a powerful relatively safe, if done properly. Safe, if done properly, way to modulate your internal dopamine. Hopefully, I answered your question. Next question please. Sorry, I caught it raised it went off the fall, as well. Yes, I think you should get out once you've accomplished something. Don't get out when you panic unless it's dangerous, sorry. How can you train your brain to feel more confident moments where you tend to feel intimidated? OK, these are hard question. Because context is tricky here, because I don't know what the context is. And confidence on short time scales, and then long time scales, so confidence in school, confidence in career, those are long arc things. Whereas confidence to be able to do something in the short term is different. But remember those action sequences that trigger the release of dopamine. I've mainly talked about the dark side of dopamine, but I hopefully also talked about the sort of upward spiral that dopamine can cause, mainly by thinking about delight and things that you really enjoy. That carries over. And I would say that you want to micro slice the demands of what's maybe got you back on your heels a bit. Actually a good friend of mine who's here tonight, I think also my friend Pat, he has a great way of conceptualizing this, which is for most all endeavors we either feel back on our heels, flat footed, or forward center of mass. Like we can really do something, we're flat footed, we're back on our heels. And sometimes getting from back on our heels, lets call that lack of confidence to just on two feet, and confident enough to move forward or at least stay in the game. That's going to require you could lean on different tools. I can't say which would be ideal for the circumstance you have in mind. But I do think that having a way to calm yourself will give you access to more internal resources. We know this. This was something I meant to bring up during the discussion about fear versus love, et cetera, trying to access delight and love. When we are in a state of fear or stress or anxiety, the rule set, the options available to us, and indeed our creativity, is greatly diminished. And this has to do with the way that the prefrontal cortex interacts with an area of the brain called the insula, which relates to our internal landscape. And there's this weird phenomenon, which is that normally, our brain-- our thinking brain and our rule setting brain can-- it leads the brain parts that control and pay attention to how we feel internally. And that's why for instance, if you feel a little nervous you can still do something. At some point you get stressed enough. And we know this from work by my colleague David Spiegel, it reverses. And these areas of the brain that are paying attention like how flushed my face is, or whether or not I'm sweating, or my breathing, actually start to shut down creative decision making. So I would say the way to have more confidence is to learn to control that stress and keep the part of your brain. The prefrontal cortex is that part that can come up with new rules that can be funny that can be creative. That keeps that brain part leading. The way to think about this is, the prefrontal cortex is sort of like the coach, and the rest of your brain are sort of like the players. And if you get too stressed, the players start to lead the game and the coach follows, and kind of drags them along. So I would encourage you to focus on real-time stress modulation, and to raise your stress threshold using the sorts of tools we talked about. And to register your wins. I didn't get into this in too much detail, but one of the amazing things about the dopamine system is that it's highly subject to your interpretation. If you tell yourself that a fail was a win, and you can see or conceptualize some way in which that's actually true, you get to tap into the dopamine system. You might think that's crazy. You can cheat your own brain. You can cheat your own neurochemistry. And indeed you can. You can change the time, space-time reference. And we see this with examples like Nelson Mandela or Viktor Frankl. You read their stories trapped in little cells, confined, imprisoned. And they come up with new ways to access the dopamine system by now not thinking about what they're not getting, but thinking about what they can control in their immediate experience. Many examples of this throughout literature and history. And the dopamine system is the life force system. I don't say that in any loose way. Dopamine is life force. It's the wish and the desire to continue. It's persistence. And so if you can think about what might seem like a failure and really spend some time thinking about not the potential wins on the outside, but how you can conceptualize that as a potential win internally, you really do get to achieve an internal chemical win. And that chemical win sets you up for more real wins, hopeful that make sense. It's incredible how contextualize the dopamine system is. But if it weren't, why would it matter if we're talking about money or mates or food or job or school? You don't get 50 reward systems and motivation systems. You get one, and that's the dopamine system. Next question please. What is the competing mechanism behind bilateral eye movement, EMDR, that helps resolve psychological trauma? The competing mechanism. Well, let me try and answer as best I can. I'm not sure I understand the full extent of the question. But let me-- EMDR, moving your eyes from side to side, right? And then recounting a trauma is a very common and actually one of the four approved treatments that are behavioral for trauma. So it's taken seriously in the psychiatric and psychological community for good reason. It tends to work best for single event traumas as opposed to entire childhoods. No joke there. Some people have their entire childhood that was traumatic. Other people they experience a single event trauma or repeated periods of the same or similar type of trauma. Eye movements from side to side have been shown in a number of studies to very potently reduce the activity of a brain structure called the amygdala, which most people are familiar with, because of the character from the Star Wars movie, Amygdala. There's a neuroscientist somewhere on that team. It is indeed a threat detection center and when you move through space, not outer space, but when you walk like this your eyes actually generate these subtle side to side shifts, unless you're focusing on a specific target. And my lab and other laboratories have found that leads to a very potent quieting of the threat detection system. And then EMDR is essentially a process of pairing that calmer state with no threat detection system activated with the recount of something that normally would be quite triggering. So you've heard of Pavlovian conditioning, like a bell rings and the animal gets fed and animal salivate eventually, just the bell will evoke the salivation. You're doing the reverse of that. It's called behavioral desensitization. It has an underlying mechanism, et cetera. But the idea is to pair a calm state with recount of something. It has been shown to be successful. There are people who think that the side to side eye movements and the recount of trauma may actually be invoking some form of hypnosis. My colleague David Spiegel's an expert in clinical hypnosis, has appeared on my podcasts, Rituals podcasts and a few other podcasts. And talks about, this it is not stage hypnosis, it's clinical hypnosis. So there may be something going on there. EMDR-- again, some people get great relief from it. Other people don't. What's kind of nice is that this eye movements from side to side or simply taking a walk as long as you're not looking at your phone and not allowing your eyes to move from side to side, is a very good way to shut down the fear and stress system. So taking a walk I think is relaxing for obvious reasons. And there are data showing that part of the reason why animals scratch at the door and want to go for a walk may not actually be the exercise. There's kind of an anxiety and then an anxiety relief that occurs. Of course, they have to go to the bathroom too. One of Costello's great joys in life was just peeing on everything outdoors, thankfully. So the psychological trauma rewiring, unfortunately there haven't been a lot of brain imaging studies looking at this long term of how well EMDR works. What I think is going to happen in the next few years by the way, is it is not going to be a discussion around, should you do EMDR, should you do transcranial magnetic stimulation, should you do behavioral therapy? It's going to be combination therapies. Combination therapies, including pharmacologic manipulations to essentially give a boost to the systems that encourage neuroplasticity, like dopamine and serotonin and adrenaline. And then also then perform EMDR. And if you want to talk about what's happening in the landscape of clinical trials on some of the psychedelics, I'm happy to talk about it. They're still illegal, but they are being used in clinical trials. And very interesting stuff is happening there. OK, next question please. What new research or interventions are you most excited about in the realm of health and wellness? So what I think is going to be very interesting in the next few years really reflects my memory obsession that you've seen a little bit of tonight. But the thing that I think is going to be most useful-- and I've seen this in science before and I think we're going to see it in health and wellness. It's that there are all these tools and all these people, and he's saying this and she's saying that. But what, we're going to start paying attention to is, what are the common themes? And a broader and more important theme is going to be one of modulation versus mediation. What do I mean? Well, if someone were to pull a fire alarm right now, and please don't, that will shift our attention and make it hard to focus on what I'm saying. And knowing me I'd probably just stay up here talking. Do we think that fire alarms mediate attention? No, they modulate it. If it were very cold in this room like it was when we first got here tonight, or arctic cold-- hopefully it's warmed up a bit. It has and I'm so sorry. So sorry. Yeah, I attempted to-- yeah. I almost thought maybe we all just do a bunch of breathing to heat up like adrenaline release. But these days getting groups of people to all breathe on each other is not exactly a-- I can see that might go the wrong way in terms of what people interpret. So the idea here is that certain things directly mediate something. Like a physiological side directly calms you down quickly. It mediates the calming response. Getting good sleep makes you less easily triggered. It modulates stress. But is sleeping directly mediating stress control? No, and I think this is really important. And this brings up the topic of the gut-brain axis. The gut is rich with these little bugs, bacteria trillions of them, which is an eerie thought to me. But also the surface of your skin, the surface of your eyes, you have a skin microbiome, a nasal microbiome. Every mucosal lining has a microbiome. In fact, think about this. This is a crazy but worthwhile tangent. Have you ever bitten the inside of your mouth? It sucks, right? And you get cut and it hurts. But guess what, the inside of your mouth heals without a scar. Think about that. Weird, right? You cut anywhere else on your body, and depending on how well you heal, and your age and your immune status, you get a scar. Your mouth is filled with bacteria and it's open to the world, but the gut microbiome, provided it's healthy, provides an incredible ability to heal quickly. And I'm not somebody who's done a lot of acupuncture. I went a few times. And now there's interesting science happening on acupuncture. But what's the first thing they do when you walk in there? Let me see your tongue. And then they go oh, yeah. And they have this cool intuition that's not based on Western mechanistic science. It's more of an intuition based on millions, if not billions of data points that have been put into these charts. It's pretty cool. And what they are looking at, I believe and from what my colleagues who work on microbiome tell me is, they can look at the pallor of your tongue, in particular in the back and get a sense of whether or not the microbiome there is of the appropriate stuff. But they don't go, oh, lactobacillus. Remember this all end to illness, right? But then, Oh you're just biotic. Instead they get a sense. Now, parents of small babies learn to detect all sorts of things coming out of essentially every orifice of the child as a readout of health because the child doesn't have language. And a dog owners unfortunately you want to do this too, for better or for worse. Probably for better, right? So we have this intuition about gut health. But gut health would be another example, where it's very clear now that fiber can be helpful but it's mostly consuming these fermented foods that have been used for ages. But low sugar fermented foods of the natto, kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, et cetera, all these things depending on which culture you're in, they come in different forms. Certain yogurts, et cetera, that allow the gut to be healthy. And it modulates a huge number of systems. So I don't think that you're going to cure depression by adjusting your gut microbiome. But if your gut microbiota are not well, and you improve that, it will indeed shift the neurotransmitter systems of your brain and give you a elevated mood. That shouldn't come as a surprise anymore. But I think that the whole world thinks like, gosh it must be the serotonin in the gut. No, it's actually not serotonin gut. It's that the gut microbiota create chemicals that actually become serotonin in the brain, or become dopamine in the brain. And so I think that the gut microbiome, I would put in the same category, although not quite as important. I would put it in the category of like sleep. It modulates a huge number of other processes. It doesn't mediate them. , So sunlight, sleep, healthy gut microbiome, exercise, good nutrition, social connection, these things all create this general milieu or environment of health. I would like to see more distinction between modulating and mediating effects and tools out there, because I also see a lot of unnecessary argument. People are like, there's no example that improving your gut microbiome cures depression. Of course there's not. But there are really good examples. If your gut microbiome is off that improving it can improve mood, which depending on where you are on that spectrum of depression can really relieve things. So I think that the future of health, we hear so much about personalized medicine and matched to your genome. But we don't even have the basic. Most people don't even have the basics right. And if you watch or listen to the podcast long enough, hopefully certain themes start to repeat themselves. But a key theme that you learn in science, you teach your students, does it modulate or does it mediate it? You need to be careful with your language there. And there's great information, or as we say, interpretation power there. If you understand the difference then I think we can go a long way by making that distinction modulating versus mediating. There are probably other things that modulate health that I'm overlooking now just because of the flow that I'm in. The CoolMitt. Yeah, the CoolMitt. Palmer cooling. OK, I promised to talk about Palmer cooling. Well, I'll do it now. Palmer cooling they changed the Q&A format. What can I say, this is like teaching in the classroom. All right, very briefly. The Palmer cooling, which is essentially placing-- you can cool the core of the body most quickly by placing cold objects on the hands, the bottoms of the feet, or on the top of the face, because of the arrangement of vasculature. Normally, you've got this arteries, capillaries, veins things, but at those locations in the body, you skip the capillaries and you can basically-- you're not really passing cooling the body, but you're cooling off the core of the body more quickly. And, if you do that in between sets of exercise or during a run or cycling you can dramatically increase your ability to continue. I actually use the CoolMitt for cognitive work. But you don't need a CoolMitt. Sorry, guys. You can just get a thing of ice water or just very cold water. And I know it sounds trivially easy, but you're actually just cooling your core by putting your hands or even one hand on a relatively cold thing of water or ice. But not so cold that it constricts the vasculature there. This is the incredible work of my colleague at Stanford Dr. Craig Heller. Why wouldn't more people do this if you can double the amount of endurance? Believe it or not. Or double the number of sets of exercise you can do or feel more alert and do more cognitive work. Why wouldn't more people do it? Because people just don't do it. And it sounds crazy. It really sounds crazy, but it's a real thing. And I wish more people would do it. The athletes at Stanford do it. People in the military do it. So people who know and they use it, enjoy it. It's just it's almost like seems to off target from what you're trying to accomplish. I don't know, for some reason, people are finally onboard breathing like in a specific way as a useful tool. A few years ago no one was into that. I mean, just think of how far we've come. It's incredible. People are talking about psychedelics, meditation, breathing. I think the pandemic for all its pains and, you know, what a challenging period for all sorts of reasons, did wake people up to the idea that you have to take control over your health, because there's no magic fairy coming to do it for you. And with all due respect there's no government agency that's going to drop off the kit at your front door of like, here's how you take good care of yourself. So it just not going to happen. And it wouldn't happen under any circumstances. So it's a personal responsibility issue. All right. What lessons from skateboarding? The failure part. The failure, failure, or failure. I mean, for me skateboarding-- never was a good skateboarder. I still have close friends in that community and our photographer and a guy who does all the visuals and the other guys do the visuals for our podcast, Mike Blabac, Chris, and Martin, all of that community. I think that for me that community was really-- as Mike will sometimes say, skateboarders hate everything, meaning they have a very high threshold for what they consider acceptable. It's not just what you do. It's how you do it. Super important. And I think in neuroscience, there are a lot of-- there's a lot of stuff. In science in general, there are so many papers and there are so many experiments. How do you navigate that landscape? I think it helped me develop a sense of taste. But the taste that I'm referring to is not necessarily a taste of which science is cool or not cool. That too, but it came through a few times tonight when I was talking about my mentors. I picked back then skateboarding because I really liked the people. And also you didn't need your parents to go to a game. And so that worked for me. And you could kind of make your own schedule. And I do think it's very important to the extent that you can, in science and in everything, to surround yourself with the kinds of people that you just really enjoy being around. And so to me, the podcast, running a lab, feels a lot like skateboarding. It's the same energy. It's the same neurochemical systems firing, so that's-- yeah, that one. Next? Favorite Feynman. Oh, I know that's inappropriate. I do have a Feynman story, but it's inappropriate. Darn it. Damn. Maybe some time. This is why I don't drink. Good decision making. Well, I read all of Feynman's books. So I had the pleasure I never met him. He was dead before I was born. But my dad did. And he had good Feynman stories and they were inappropriate. So the cool thing about Feynman was that he didn't really care if people understood the specifics of what he was talking about. He just wanted people to get turned on to how amazing physics was. And he loved general principles. And one of the things-- the example that sometimes given out. I don't know how many of you're familiar with the Feynman books. But surely, you're joking Mr Feynman or what do you care what other people think, all of that stuff it's wonderful. He picked locks. When he worked at Los Alamos Labs, they were working on the bomb. And he basically-- well, there and elsewhere. And every morning the offices used to come in and he would spread all the top secret papers out on the floor. He would break into the safes at night. And then they were perplexed who could do this. And he liked safe cracking. Literally like national security secrets just for fun, prankster. He also bongo drummed naked on the roof of Caltech. And he did most of his writing of theorems in strip clubs, in fact. Learnt to draw late in life, was really into flotation tanks, and very curious about but never did psychedelics. That's as I understand. But one of the cool Feynman factoids is that when he was a kid, he talks about when he was a child that his dad used to take him birdwatching. And he'd say, oh, well that's a whatever scrub jay and that's whatever thrush and that's the-- and his dad said, no don't cloud your mind with naming and taxonomy. That's not meaningful. Because then what if it's different? The pigmy thrush or the lesser or this or that. The more important thing is to start to identify principles of why certain birds behave one way and certain birds behave another. And to start finding the commonalities and the regularities. And that's a theme that I obviously tonight have tried to impose. And it's actually something that I can't do in podcasts, necessarily because I can't thread across 40 episodes. Or something like that in the same way that I could in an evening like this. So that's an appropriate Feynman story. Also he just seemed like a delightful guy. And he's kind of cool. He's a little bit street, he had the thick accent. He was from Far Rockaway, but he didn't really care much what people thought, or he did and he pretended he didn't. Care for when people tell you they don't care what people think. I think he did to the extent that it still allowed him to get the message out there. OK, next question please. My horse. Wow. I love this. I delight in all things animals, but especially horses, because my high school girlfriend had a horse. And they do that thing where people go, oh you know, horses can detect how-- they know more about you than you know. And then I get onto the horse, and the horse like this this and this. And it's like a litmus test. Having a girlfriend with a horse was very intimidating for me actually. I felt like I had to compete with the horse. She spent all this time with the horse, it's very large. Anyway, eventually I broke the horse. OK, my horse does the double inhale, long exhale often. He's a bit of a stressed guy. Warm blood? Yeah, warm blood. I used to work at the barn. I used to shovel manure and work at the barn. She brought her horse to college. . I actually followed her off to college I never would have gone to college if she hadn't gone to college. And the horses are interesting animals. They do tell you a lot. The horse does the double inhale, long exhale often. He's a bit of a stress guy. Do you suppose this physiological stress regulator transcends species? Absolutely. In fact, I mentioned warm blood. I have a colleague at Stanford and she's amazing. Her name is Sue McConnell and she is an expert in dog genetics, so you can imagine I'm always asking her questions. And we talk about dogs and we talk about horses because she also-- I thinks she raises warm bloods. And you hear about hot bloods and warm bloods. And also, if you have any familiarity with dogs, there are dogs like Costello, or like a nuclear bomb could go off and Costello might open an eye. That's the bulldog, economy of effort. They're not going to get activated unless there's a reason to do it. They are very, as we call it, parasympathetic dominant. That seesaw of autonomic arousal is just really relaxed. Getting them into action is more of an effort. There are other animals like the whippet or the Italian greyhound. Like they're always cold, that are very sympathetic dominant. And then of course, within a breed or within a species there's a range. And humans also, are within a range. I think anyone who's had children will tell you he or she has been like this since birth. Calm, easygoing, or like really easily stressed. I think that seesaw, we didn't get into tonight too much. But there's a concept with the autonomic regulation of a hinge. So don't think so much about being really stressed out or really relaxed. But certain animals, the hinge is tighten so that the seesaw just kind of tilts mellow like Costello. A bulldog almost seems like a different animal than a whippet. They're so very different. And within the category of horses-- and I'm not an expert in horse genetics, but they are selected for not just for their physical attributes, but for their psychological or temperament attributes. And you see this in dogs too. In fact, the reason I picked Costello, and Elvis can verify the stories, I read-- I wanted a dog for so many years. And I went there and there were all these puppies. And I was like I heard you need to take them in the other room one by one. And then if it barks for its siblings, you're like, oh it's a healthy puppy. So I walk in and all the dogs are running around like crazy. It was right around Christmas time, right Elvis? And they're running around and then there's one in the back. And he's taking advantage of the fact that all the other ones are running. He's just eating out of all of their bowls. And I was like, I want that one. So I took that chubby little bastard in the next room and I thought, OK, he's going to bark for his siblings. And he lay down and he took a nap. And I was like, this one. I want this one. Why did I want that one? Well, this completes the principle which is, I wanted a dog like that because I'm not like that. And I was very interested in a dog I could take care of, but also a dog that would help regulate my nervous system. And so for me having a dog like that as opposed to a whippet or something that was going constantly around is a very calming effect. And to this day memory of his snoring still puts me to sleep. So I think that your horse probably has-- it kind of idles a little bit higher. Think about the rpm. You know, revs a little bit higher at a given speed-- more rpm at a given speed. That's the way I think about the autonomic system. How do you reset that? Well, this is why a lot of exercise is good, right? And certainly my girlfriend's horse was crazy. It was gelded late. And it was crazy. I almost said nuts but that's like a bad pun so it was not nuts but it was crazy. It was gelded late. Next question. Is there any science behind staying motivated or developing discipline? Oh, so this represents the higher tier of where I think things are going to go in the next few years, where we're going to start seeing this convergence of psychology and biology, where we can get to these harder concepts. I like to think that we can stay motivated through a simple process that now will make sense to you. Because the last thing I covered was toggling back and forth between our ability to be gritty and linen, kind of in friction, maybe even a little anger, fear, competitiveness, et cetera. That kind of grinding in. But that the more sustaining fuel, the sort of hybrid version, a hybrid fuel model would be one in which you can access that. But that's a depletable and not so renewable resource without a lot of rest. Meaning, working hard out of anger, determination, and kind of grit will work, but when you are depleted you have to stop for a long while. Whereas if you can access this delight system, which is really one of dopamine and serotonin, both. In other words, and I want to think of a different way to put this, but to try and think about what sorts of things and tools allow you to be and feel most loving, I know it sounds weak. But it's anything but weak to be most loving in the verb sense of the word toward what you're doing. I actually used to use this trick in college when I'd encounter a topic I hated. I would tell myself I'm really-- I'm just going to fall in love with this by trying to find the gems within it. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. But the wish to do it that way as opposed to OK, I'm just going to grind this out, at least for me at the time was a powerful tool. So motivation and-- discipline is a tricky one. That's sort of the just do it thing. You need tools to modulate your stress and to get your sleep-- do all the basic things right. Set the right context for you to be in your best chance of being disciplined. And that itself is its own form of discipline. But in terms of continual motivation you're not going to manage to go against the grain for very long. People have managed to go against challenge for a very long time-- for a very long times. In fact, I was reading recently about the psychology of people who've been kidnapped. And they have this odd trick that they used. Have you heard about this is sort of like Stockholm syndrome? But they actually convinced themselves to fall in love with their captors. And then they come up with new ways to escape them, which is kind of cool. So there's something about mentally feeling like you're trying to go from back on your heels to flat footed. That's very energetically costly. So again, these systems are very susceptible to what we call context or top down regulation. Hopefully that helps. I know it's a little bit abstract. I wish I could give you a 1-minute exercise or make you motivated. But we do talk about tools to get adrenaline going and things like that. But spend some time thinking about what would allow you to sustain effort through positive feelings. It's not a light concept at all. Next question please. What would be your biggest piece of advice for achieving one's dreams? Boy! That's a tough one. Again, this is going to be a little abstract. I'm a believer in this idea kind of a seed message. Robert Greene has talked a lot about this, that we can all kind of think back to a event or stage of our life. Typically it's before puberty for other reasons that are kind of interesting. But where we delight in something. So for me it was fish. And obviously now I don't need to work on fish. It wasn't about the fish. I hope that came through. I mean aquaria are really cool, but it's not about the fish. It was something about the way they moved. It was something about the way that it tickled my excitement. I used to get dropped off at this little pet shop in California Avenue called Monette's Pet Shop. And my mom used it as childcare. She would drop me off there and I had this book and I would log all the tropical fish, and which ones could be with which ones, and then I would-- I was obsessed. But for me it was something about organizing and being able to make reliable predictions. It was about parsimony. It was about principles as opposed to-- and the colors delighted me and all that kind of stuff. The equipment delighted me, but then I hit puberty. And then it was something else. And then I went to college and it was something else. And I got a girlfriend and it was something else. So it changes over time. But this is why I recommend to that young 15-year-old person that they learn to tap into that sense of like Oh, this is cool. Like this feels cool. I know not everyone else thinks it's cool. Maybe they do. Like this feels good. I actually have a somatic experience of this. I'm not a very semantically oriented person. I'm more up here. But I actually know if I'm on to something, if this left arm just kind of starts fidgeting, it's like I want to move or like some people-- you can start to identify ways in which you suddenly have this positive energy. It's not a fear energy. It's almost like a magnetism to things. And just don't be confused or misdirected in thinking that it's that thing. It's that energy or that attraction to something that feels right that is your-- I wish we had these divining rod to find water. That's your tool. It's like antennae, you want to grow your antennae. So how do you follow your dreams? Well, I never thought I'd do a podcast. I never thought I'd become a neuroscientist. You have to be willing of course, to take risks and to iterate quickly, but not so quickly that you fail out of the game, et cetera, if you do get back in, et cetera. But it's really about developing an awareness. Now, the key thing is you're not going to find this by going up a mountain and sitting there or waiting for your passion to just kind of rock it in, or piano fall onto your head. It's not going to happen that way. You have to interact with the sensory world and different kinds of people. And you have to be a little bit of a adventurer in a safe way, of course. An adventure and learn to recognize the signals. And some people are very in tune with this. There's an amazing podcast with Rick Rubin recently on Joe Rogan's Podcast where he talks about the creative processes. Kind of this-- it seems like whatever's going on in that beard of his just connects to the world. And he can just like-- there, that's where you need to go and that's-- But that's part of the magic, is you don't really know. And because it's all energetic-- it's all energetic. And when I say energetic, I don't mean in the mystical sense. I mean you have to learn to sense those fluctuations in energy. Some people can sense them very easily because they're very mellow. And if something gets them really excited they notice as a big delta, as we say in science, big change. Other people they ride kind of high all the time. And so everything is exciting to them, and they miss a lot of the subtle fluctuations in what's really special and right for them. In fact, mania is characterized by hyper elevated levels of dopamine and everything is a good idea. And depression is the opposite. Nothing is a good idea. Nothing's going to work. And those are the extremes. And those are rough conditions obviously. But for most people, it's about learning to detect those subtle fluctuations. And every time-- every single time you find somebody who is exceptional at their craft and doing well in life-- there are a lot of people who are exceptional at their craft, but not necessarily doing well on the whole. Those people have a kind of intuition about what feels good to them. This year's Nobel Prize winner in chemistry is my colleague, Carolyn Bertozzi. And all I know of her, except the fact that she's an amazing chemist, is they did this interview with her. And she said that when everyone would go out in college she was finding excuses to stay home and read organic chemistry. Now, that to me sounds like a bad night. But for her it was pure delight. And she's wired for that. And I think her work is going to be vitally important and transformative for humanity. I really do. So how do you succeed in chasing your dreams? You succeed in identifying what they are. But you don't know at the outset. You want to find the energy to find the right path and continually course correct when you will undoubtedly be off your path. That's essentially what I've done. I still look for the feeling of delighting in Costello or the cuttlefish. That's what I'm looking for. It's not a template I have to match, but that's my like, oh, yeah I know what that feels like. It's like a texture. It's like if you think about a bunch of different textures of sandpaper, it's like this one that just feels really good. And so you're comparing everything to that, because the system that involves all these chemicals, you'll find it if you learn to pay attention to it. But you won't find it sitting, staring at your belly button or going up a mountain. You have to be in sensory experience in order to find it. Reflection is good but you need to get into action. Wow. All right well. OK, so psilocybin. Opinion of the psychedelics. Generally, we just had an episode with my colleague Nolan Williams, who's a triple board certified neurologist psychiatrist. It's a fun thing about working at Stanford. It's also very humbling because you're like, whoa who are these people? They have three board certifications. The psilocybin-- first of all, not for everybody. People with psychosis, it is still illegal decriminalized in certain places. So obviously the cautionary notes people who have drug addiction issues or other kinds of addiction issues need to be thoughtful about diving into a neurochemical landscape like that. But it does appear that the clinical trials on one macro dose. This is what's interesting to me. A lot of people talk about micro-dosing psilocybin, but the data at least according to Matthew Johnson, who is also on the podcast, the data for micro-dosing are not really there, frankly. The data on single session macro dose, the sort of heroic doses that have been talked about in the psychonaut community for a depression and to some extent PTSD, and for eating disorders and sort of end of life preparation are quite encouraging. In fact, the current data suggests that about 2/3 of people achieve lasting relief from one session. Now, keep in mind those are guided sessions with physicians in the room, et cetera. I do think there's a potential hazard of all psychedelics, which is they alter-- this includes MDMA or especially MDMA, they alter the chemical landscape in you, such that a lot of things can serve as attractors in that state. Meaning you can get really into the sound of music in an MDMA session, feel connected to that, and waste the opportunity for some more meaningful transformative rewiring. And I do think that's worth paying attention to. So that's the usefulness of having a therapeutic guide, as they can continually steer you back to what at least for you is the more meaningful work. But it's very encouraging. And Nolan Williams, who I trust, is again triple board certified M.D. Said that in the studies of lifetime perceived individual and societal risk, of all the compounds out there except for caffeine, psilocybin is at the bottom of the list. Whereas things like heroin, cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine sit at the top of the list. Actually, alcohol quite high on that list at certain amounts of consumption. So I'm very excited about what's happening in the landscape of psilocybin, but I'm not so excited about the micro-dosing data. Very excited about the single heroic dose data. One interesting thing there perhaps, what seems to be the unifying feature of a successful psilocybo-- psilocybin, excuse me session, is that at some point the person feels as if it's like too much of a autonomic thing. It kind of get to this point and then they are encouraged to \"let go.\" And I'm fascinated by this concept of letting go, because I'm a neuroscientist. We don't know what that means, but it seems like being able to ride the wave of autonomic arousal from top to bottom. Seems to be very powerful for trauma and depression treatment. And this is interesting. A lot of people think that one of the major issues in humans nowadays is we're stressed about a lot of things. But we never actually get to go into the full stress response, and then let it relax again. And catharsis was big at one point. Scream therapy, Steve Jobs is going to scream therapies. That whether or not catharsis is healthy or not has been debated but the data are kind of pointing to the fact that it may be provided that the catharsis is not. Obviously someone damaging themselves for somebody else. So maybe we should all be screaming a lot more. Why does my desire to eat disappear after I use the sauna? Oh, interesting. I can go in hungry and get out with no desire to eat. I can only speculate. The sauna or any kind of deliberate heat exposure that's uncomfortable releases this molecule dynorphin. This is actually the same molecule that's released under conditions of alcohol withdrawal. It makes you feel agitated and not good. And then there's this rebound. The way it feels good is later, it causes this upregulation in the so-called mu opioid receptors. So the chemicals that you have, your so-called endogenous opioids, not the opioids that are related to the opioid crisis. But the ones that you naturally make are able to have a more robust effect after the sauna. Dynorphin is an appetite suppressant and for reasons related to kind of general discomfort in the body. So that's the only reason I can speculate. There are a number of other things that sauna does including massive increases in growth hormone provided you don't sauna too much. So if you do it once a week four 20-minute sessions spaced five minutes apart, you get these enormous increases in growth hormone. If you start doing it more often you get still significant, but smaller increases in growth hormone. And my team, this is how the podcast goes too. At some point Rob just goes, it's enough. So if you think the episodes are long now, they'd be a lot longer. Listen, I just want to-- before we part, I know it's a Sunday night and people have to go, I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight. I know that at least for me I'm still sort of baffled, but pleasantly so that people are interested in investing time to come out and hear hours of a nerd like me and talk about science and tools. And I'm delighted that people are hopefully gleaning some useful information. Please do pass along the information. I didn't invent this stuff as I mentioned before. I was not consulted on the design phase. I have no domain over it. This is the stuff of mother nature. And whatever other beliefs you have, they're here in us. And of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't finish by saying, have a wonderful night and thank you for your interest in science. AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]",

  {
    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science, and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Jeff Cavaliere. Jeff Cavaliere holds a Master of Science in Physical Therapy and is a certified strength and conditioning specialist. He did his training at the University of Connecticut Storrs, one of the top five programs in the world in physical therapy and sports medicine. I discovered Jeff Cavaliere over 10 years ago from his online content. His online content includes information about how to train for strength, how to train for hypertrophy, which is muscle growth, how to train for endurance, as well as how to rehabilitate injuries to avoid muscular imbalances, nutrition and supplementation. I've always found his content to be incredibly science based, incredibly clear, sometimes surprising, and always incredibly actionable. It is therefore not surprising that he has one of the largest online platforms for fitness, nutrition, supplementation, and injury rehabilitation. Jeff has also worked with an enormous number of professional athletes and has served as head physical therapist and assistant strength coach for the New York Mets. Again, the content that Jeff Cavaliere has posted online has been so immensely useful to me over the years, that I was absolutely thrilled to get the chance to sit down with him and ask him about everything from how to train in terms of how to split up the body parts that you train across the week, how to integrate strength training and endurance training, when to stretch, how to stretch. Indeed, we talked about nutrition, we talk a bit about supplementation. We talk about how to really avoid creating imbalances in muscle and in neural control over muscle. This is one thing that's really wonderful about Jeff is he really has an understanding of not just how muscles and bones, and tendons and ligaments work together, but how the nervous system interfaces with those. We talked about the mental side of training, including when to bring specific concentration to the muscles that you're training, and when to think more about how to move weights through space and think more about the movements overall. I'm certain that you'll find the conversation that we held to be immensely useful and informative for your fitness practices and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general, and how to set up a lifelong fitness practice, one that will give you the strength that you desire, one that will give you the aesthetic results that you desire. One that will set you up for endurance and cardiovascular health, basically an overall fitness program. I really feel this is where Jeff Cavaliere shines above and beyond so many of the other PTs and fitness so-called influencers that are out there. Again, everything is grounded in science, everything is clear, and everything is actionable. And while we do cover an enormous amount of information during today's episode, if you want to dive even deeper into that information, you can go to athleanx.com, where you'll find some of Jeff's programs. You can also find him at Athlean-X on YouTube. There you'll find videos for instance, like the, how to repair or heal from lower back pain. Something that I actually followed directly long before I ever met Jeff, has over 32 million views, and that is not by accident, it's because the protocols there again are surprising and actionable. They relieved my back pain very quickly without surgery. So I'm immensely grateful for that content. And it extends into everything from again, hypertrophy, endurance and strength training and so on. Again, it's athleanx.com as the website, Athlean-X on YouTube, and also @athleanx on Instagram. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements. We've done that for several reasons. First of all, the quality of their supplements is exceedingly high. Second of all, we wanted to have a location where you could find all of the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast in one easy to find place. You can now find that place at livemomentous.com/huberman. In addition, Momentous Supplements ship internationally, something that a lot of other supplement companies simply do not do. So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US, or you live abroad. Right now, not all of the supplements that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed, but that catalog of supplements is being expanded very rapidly, and a good number of them that we've talked about, some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus and other aspects of mental and physical health are already there. Again, you can find them at livemomentus.com/huberman. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1. I started taking AG1 way back in 2012. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason that I started taking AG1, and the reason I still take AG1 twice a day, is that it covers all of my foundational health needs for mental health, physical health, and performance. As I mentioned earlier, it has vitamins and minerals that cover any deficiencies I might have in my diet. It also has probiotics, and the probiotics are key for supporting the so-called gut microbiome. The gut microbiome are trillions of little microbacteria that live in our gut from our throat all the way down to the base of our gut, that support everything from our immune system to our hormone health, to the so-called gut brain access. That is, our gut and our brain are in direct communication with one another in ways that support our mood, our ability to think, and overall brain health. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3+K2. Vitamin D3 and K2 are essential for an enormous number of aspects of your mental health, physical health, and performance by impacting things like hormone regulation, calcium regulation, and cardiovascular health. Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim that special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with heating and sleep tracking and importantly cooling capacity. I've talked many times before on this podcast or another podcast about the close relationship between temperature and sleep. That is, your body temperature has to drop by about one to three degrees in order to fall asleep, and waking up involves heating up of your body by about one to three degrees. Now, some people run cold during the night. They need to heat their sleeping environment. Other people run too hot during the night. I'm one such person, I tend to wake up in the middle of the night if I get warm at all. With Eight Sleep, I'm able to cool my sleeping environment in a very precise way, even so precise that I can control the temperature at the beginning, middle, and end of the night so that I fall asleep easily, stay deeply asleep, and wake up feeling better than I've ever felt before. The Pod Pro Cover by Eight Sleep is their most advanced solution on the market for thermal regulation. It pairs dynamic, cooling and heating with biometric tracking if you want to use that. Also it has this nice feature that it'll vibrate in the morning to wake you up. I'd rather like that vibration feature too. You can add the cover to any mattress and start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit, or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. So again, it can be customized to your sleep needs. If you want to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman and check out the Pro Pod Cover and save $150 at checkout. They currently ship within the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman to save $150 at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two, all American swimmers from Stanford and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is made with performance in mind. That said, the aesthetics of ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is superb. I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system. And I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order to be able to see clearly. ROKA understands this and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses in a manner such that when you move from say a shady area to a brightly lit area, or when you are in different lit environments indoors, you can always see with crystal clarity. And they won't slip off if you sweat. In fact, they were originally designed for exercise. You can wear them while running or cycling, but they have a terrific aesthetics. So unlike a lot of so-called performance or exercise glasses that are out there that make people frankly look like cyborgs in my opinion, ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses look terrific. You'd be proud to wear them to work, or out to dinner, or when you exercise. If you want to try ROKA glasses, you can go to roka.com.

And now for my discussion with Jeff Cavaliere. Jeff, such a pleasure for me to have you here. - I'm glad to be here, it's amazing. - I'm a longtime consumer of your content. I've learned a tremendous amount about fitness, both in the weight room and cardio, nutrition things that I've applied for over a decade. So for me, this is particularly meaningful. And my goal here is really to ask a bunch of questions to which I'm interested in the answers, but also for which I know the audience is really curious about. So one of your mantras is, \"If you want to look like an athlete, train like an athlete\" and I think that's something really special that sets aside what you do from what a lot of other very well qualified people do. And in terms of the use of weights and resistance, whether or not it's body weight or weights in the gym, or pulleys versus cardio, in terms of overall health aesthetics and athleticism, is there a way that you could point to the idea that maybe people should be doing 50% resistance training and 50% cardio, maybe it's 70/30, maybe it's 30/70. And here I'm talking about the typical person who would like to maintain, or maybe even add some muscle mass, probably in particular areas for most people, as opposed to just overall mass. Although we'll talk about that later, and people who want to maintain a relatively low body fat percentage and be in good cardiovascular health. What's the sort of contour of a basic program that anybody could think about as a starting place? - I think it's like a 60/40 split, which would be leaning towards weight training, strength and then the conditioning aspect be about 40%. So if you look at it over a course of a training week, I mean, five days in a gym would be a great task. And obviously not in the gym, it could be done at home. But three days strength training, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Conditioning, Tuesday, Thursday, you know, two days. It's a pretty easy roundabout way to split that up, of course, depending upon training goals. And as you said, the aesthetic goals like that will shift dramatically. But if you want to see the benefits of both, that's probably the effect of dose for strength training and the effect of dose for conditioning at the bare minimum level. Again, being a much better performer conditioning wise, you're going to want to do more than that. - And in terms of the duration of those workouts, what's your suggestion? I've been weight training for about 30 years, running for about 30 years, and mainly for health. And have found that if I work hard in the gym or at resistance training for more than 60 minutes or so, it's very hard for me to recover, I start getting cold, I start getting weaker from workout to workout, but amazingly, at least to me, if I keep those workouts to about 10 minutes of warmup and 55 minutes or so of really hard work for resistance training, and I keep the cardiovascular work to about 30 or 45 minutes, I feel great. And I seem to make some progress, at least someplace in the workout from workout to workout. - Yeah, I mean, those are good numbers, 'cause those are kind of numbers that we usually preach. We try to keep our workouts to an hour or less if possible. Now, depending upon the split that you're following, if you're on a total body split, there's just going to be more that has to be done in a given amount of time. And again if you're training primarily for strength, that could prolong the workout, 'cause of the longer rest time is in between sets. But in general, when you're not focused on that one aspect, but the overall health picture, then you can get the job done in under an hour. And again, I always say, on top of \"If you want to look like an athlete train, like an athlete,\" is, \"You could either train longer or you could train hard, but you can't do both.\" And I really believe that the focus for me, I have a busy life, I have a lot of other things that I do believe it or not. And it's like, I want to go hard and I want to go get out. And I find that my body also responds to that, and I think a lot of guys' body respond to that. And particularly as you start to get older, I think it's the length of the workout that actually causes more problems than the intensity of what you're doing. Particularly if you're warmed up properly like you said. I've found personally that my warmup has had to become more of an integral part of my workout than it ever has before. I could get in the gym when I was 20, and I'm going right over, I'm doing the one set, two sets, I'm ready to go. You know, and I never do another workout warmup set for any of the other exercise I do the rest of the day. That's not true anymore. And I found that as long as I'm willing to sort of give myself a little bit of a warmup, the intensity is not what bothers me. I'm very much in control of the weights that I use and it doesn't bother me. But if I start to go pretty long, I start to feel achy or I start to have problems. So again, depending upon age, that also plays a factor in the length. But again, I think everybody can achieve, on a standard program, can achieve the results that they want within an hour. - In terms of splits, you mentioned splits. And so for those who aren't familiar with this term splits, it's really which body parts are you training on? Which days? Seems like almost everybody follows a weekly workout schedule. Although the body of course doesn't care about the week. There's no reason thing that once every seven days or twice every seven days makes sense physiologically, it's just the body doesn't work that. But, that's the way life is structured. I've seen you discuss three days a week, whole body workouts. I've heard of splits like a pushing one day, pulling another day, legs another day, a day off, repeat. I mean, there's so many variations on this. What are some general themes that we can throw out there? And in order to avoid the huge matrix of possibilities, you have some wonderful content that points those. And we will cap- In our caption show notes, we'll link out to some of those that different ways to design splits. But in terms of giving people a logic of how to think about splitting up body parts, what's governing the split? What are the rules and the logic that dictate a split? - For me, the first rule is will you stick to it? Like if you, 'cause there are split, I don't particularly like full body splits. And I was actually talking to Jesse about that the other day like, I don't necessarily like to have to train everything. Now of course the volumes will come down per muscle group. But if you don't like to do that, and you actually don't look forward to your workout because you're dreading having to do everything and feeling maybe too fatigued by the time your workout's over, or the fact that those generally do take a little bit longer and don't fit into your schedule. I don't care how effective the split is, a split not done is not effective. So you need to find one that fits. So maybe you go into an alternative option, like a push-pull-legs, like you mentioned. And that could be done either one cycle through the week, on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday split, or it could be twice in a week. So you're actually training six times, where you repeat it, pull-push-legs, pull-push-legs, or however you want to do it with either a day off in between the three days, or at the end of the six days. And again, that actually impacts your schedule. I've broken that down before where it's, if you put it in between the three days, it's good because you're giving yourself an extra rest day in between, but it starts to shift that day off every week as we wrap around. So for those guys that we're choosing that seven day schedule out of convenience in our heads, it starts to mess with that off day. So others like to just keep it predictably, let's say on a Sunday, and train six days in a row. But that's a better way to maybe group similar muscle actions together, which I think, I definitely prefer that, because if I'm going to be training pulling movements, at least there there's a synergy between them. And I feel like I'm looking to achieve one goal that day. And then, I mean, quite honestly, you can go back to the bro-split days, and those still work effectively. There's a reason why they worked in the past. I think that science shows that there's smarter ways to do them these days. Like you can come back and hit a related muscle, so you could do, let's say biceps on one day and then come back two days later and do back, realizing again, synergy between the exercises there, your biceps are going to get re-stimulated again. So you could figure out ways to make that work, but the thing that I think is effective there, is that tends to be one of the ones that people like the most. Because they can go in, they get their pump, they feel good. It's pretty solely focused on one muscle group. - Is that the definition of a bro-split? One... - One muscle group a day? - Yeah, I see, so it's very much geared towards strength and aesthetics really maximizing... - Probably more aesthetics than strength, yeah. You're just... - Hence the bro, the bro name. - But again, like, you know, in here I am a science guy and I could appreciate the benefits of a bro-split. Especially 'cause again, like to what end? Who's goal are we trying to achieve here? Those are ours. Like if I'm applying my standards and my goals or even like athletic ideals, but they just want to get in shape, then it's perfectly fine to do a bro split in that instance, if you're sticking to it again and you're seeing the results that you want to see from it. But they're able to really keep their focus on one muscle, they get to focus on. Look, a lot of times people struggle with the way of an exercise feels until their second or third set. Like they don't have that proper percept of ability to kind of lock in on an exercise. So spending a few, not only sets in the same exercise, but then doing another exercise for the same muscle group helps them to dial in a little bit better and get more out of their training. - Yeah, that raised a really interesting, I think important question. Early on when I started resistance training, which was when I was 16 in high school, I got in touch with and I was learning from Mike Menzer. - Me too, that's crazy. - And Mike was very helpful. Very, very helpful. We got to be friendly... - So, I just read his book, I didn't get a chance to be him, so I'm jealous, right? - Well, back then no internet, I paid by Western Union type thing to send him some money - From the back of the magazine. - And then he got on the phone with me and my mother at the time was like, why is this grown man calling the house? And he gave me a very straightforward split, which was shoulders, arms one day, he had me taking two days off and then training legs and then two days off and then chest and back, et cetera. - And that's a variation of a bro-split too. Where you're sort of breaking them down that way, chest them back or chest them bis, you know? - And it worked very well for me, I probably would've, because of my age I think, and because I was untrained, I think, largely untrained, I think it would've grown on many different programs, but it worked very well for me. I eventually just made that in every other day thing. Shoulders and arms day off, legs day or two off, 'cause if you hit legs right, at least for me, I'm not training the next day. And then I'm not doing much of anything athletic the next day, and chest, back and repeat and so on. And the reason I found that helpful is I almost always recovered between workouts. The six day a week program of push-pull-legs, push-pull-legs, to me seems excruciating from two standpoints. One is, at least with my recovery abilities, or lack of recovery abilities, I can't imagine coming back feeling fresh. And the other one is, if I'm in the gym more than four days a week, I really start to fatigue it about the whole psychological experience of it. Whereas if I'm in there three or four days a week. In other words, if I put a day off in between each workout, I really want to be there. And I get in there with a lot of fire. And I'm also doing other things on the off days. So I think that, I love that you mentioned the split that you'll stick to. And that you can bring the intensity to, because I think that that's really important. I sometimes hear about two a day training. I've done two a day training twice in my lifetime, both times I got sick two days later. That's correlation, not causation. But is there ever an instance where two a day weight training makes sense for the non-drug assisted, typical recovery ability person? - Actually, I think it makes sense in some scenarios, but it doesn't make sense practically for a lot of people's schedules. So like if you could break down, let's say you were going to do even some version of a total body session, or maybe like you're going to do an upper lower split, right? You could do an upper workout and do the anterior chain or the pushing portion of that in one session and then come back and do the pulling session later on at night, if you had the opportunity to. The thing that you benefit from there is the freshness of focus. Again, like something in my head is sacrificed by the time you get towards the latter half of whatever workout you're in. To the same point you made before like, when you start to approach that 50 minutes an hour mark, you are either losing focus, you're losing energy, you're losing contract viability, you're losing something. And if you're relegating whatever it is, the pulling portion of that to the end of that workout, something suffers so that, and if they realize that's happening, then maybe you switch them up the next time you do the workout where the pulling portion of the upper workout goes first, and then the pushing goes later, so you're at least not just continuing that cycle, but at the same time, if you were able to kind of split them up, you get a chance to kind of take a break, you could have that freshness of focus again, and you could actually get a better effort in, 'cause again, I think effort drives the results. So if the effort is not compromised, then you should be able to do that. But systemically is that a problem? And I think that it is a problem for a lot of people. It's just hard to, it's hard to rev the engine up a lot of times in the day. You warm that thing up once, it's like that car in the winter, you get it going once, you're lucky, okay, now you got to drive it the rest of the day. But you put it in the garage and try to start it the next day, it's a problem. So, you know, young people can get away with it a lot more than older people could. - Well, I've never had a strong recovery quotient, but if I stick to this one day off in between, every once in a while, two days in a row training, maybe because I have to travel and I want to make sure I get all the workouts and kind of thing, I seem to be okay. I like your example of warming up the car, spoken like a true east coaster, or those of us are on the west coast, I took a moment there, but we folks from the East Coast and the Midwest, get it, and certainly from Europe. In terms of the mixing up of cardiovascular training and resistance training, same day, different day, which one should come first, which one should come second? If one main goals, again, everyone listening has different goals are, most people would like to either maintain or gain some muscle. I don't know many people that want to lose muscle. To maintain or gains some muscle, usually in specific locations on their body, most people would like to be a bit leaner or a lot leaner. There are a few people out there that are either naturally lean or don't want, or actually just want to gain weight. But assuming that people want to get leaner, put on some muscle, maintain muscle, and want to have a healthy heart and a healthy brain, which basically requires a healthy cardiovascular system, how would you incorporate cardiovascular work into the overall weekly regimen? - So again, I think that the bare minimum is probably twice a week in terms of cardiovascular. If you want to have some semblance of cardiovascular conditioning. But I think most people who actually need it more or want to pursue it more than that are going to need more time to do that. So at some point it can't just be relegated to a day off, or a day off from the weight training workouts. So at some point it has to occur on the same day. And in that case, I just like to put it, if that is, you're not your primary goal, but you're looking more for the, just the overall picture, the aesthetics you mentioned, putting muscle on in certain areas, then I would put it at the end of the workout. 'Cause you don't want it in any way compromise the weight training work out. And as we've sort of referenced a couple times already, the intensity of those workouts is important. And we know there's a strength component to those workouts also that is going to be a helpful stimulus for growth. So the conditioning, the cardio, that stuff done prior to any training, strength training, workout, is likely going to impair your ability to perform at your best. So unless it's just done for a quick little warmup in the beginning, but then it's not sustained long enough really to be a benefit for cardiovascular conditioning. So I just like to put that at the end, realizing that even if my effort level is lower, my output is lower, if it's still placing a demand on my cardiac output to get that conditioning effect because I'm fatigued, it still has a demand on my cardiac output, so it's still achieving its goal, but it didn't interfere with my main goal of being able to increase my performance in the gym. - Got it. And in terms of the form of cardiovascular training, I've seen you do a number of, I have to say very impressive high intensity interval type work. So burpee type work, or pushups with crunches mixed into them, anyway, people can see your videos, I didn't describe those in the best way, but rather than on the treadmill or out jogging for 30-45 minutes, is that because you prefer higher intensity, higher heart rate type training, or is it because you live in cold Connecticut, and you don't want to be out jogging on the roads in the middle of the winter? - I think all the above, I mean, those are factors from a personal level, but I think that if you are- If we could blend function across these realms and not have such a delineation between, this is my way training, and this is my conditioning, but figure out a way to blend them together, I always think that you've got a better opportunity to get that more well rounded result. And I like to kind of mix up that straight conditioning work and also some of the footwork drills. We have some high expectations for guys that come into our programs, like to just do some footwork drills. - Like ladders. - Like ladders, or line drills or something. And you know what happens? People become intrigued and interested. Like I never, I haven't tried this since high school. And they become interested in just the challenge of it, and then as we become almost distracted by the challenge, we're now like finding ourselves conditioning. And I always think that's an important part, that sometimes you got to draw people in to show them what they might be interested in. And from the output or the effect of it, I just think that when you're able to blend some, still maintain some of that strength training into the exercise, as you mentioned, let's say I'm doing some kind of a push up or a burpee, there is an anaerobic component to that that is going to be helpful, that then rather than just walking or just jogging. Not to say that that isn't an effective means for strict cardiac conditioning, it's one of the ways that we've had for centuries, how to do it. But I just think that if we can blend it, then it becomes maybe a little bit more interesting and you get some of those crossover benefits, and it doesn't become so segmented in terms of what we're trying to do. - I love the idea of bringing some mental challenge and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning. That's not something that I've thought of before, and it's simply 'cause I've overlooked it, but it makes sense because, my sister who's reasonably fit, although I'm always trying to get her to do a bit more, she always asks me, what should I take? And I'm a, I don't believe her in supplements are for certain people in certain instances, but I keep telling her, you know, it's, the behaviors are going to end, nutrition are going to have the greatest outsize positive effect. And she loves things like dance classes and things, or kickboxing, these kinds of things which, so it makes sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect and kind of trick them into doing more cardio, so to speak that's terrific. Also the neuroscientist in me just has to say, forgive me, that anytime you're engaging the two sets of motor neurons, the ones in your brain, the upper motor neurons and the ones in your spinal cord, anytime you're engaging those upper motor neurons, which are for deliberate well controlled action, you're doing a great thing for your brain in terms of brain longevity. So, now I need to incorporate some actual skills into my training. Going back to weight training a bit, one of the most important things I learned from you, so over the years was that, when training to increase muscle size, to really think, not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles. - Yeah. - I also heard this from my friend, Ben Pakulski, who's a very well accomplished, He was a bodybuilder, now he's into other aspects of fitness, teaches fitness, but don't move weights challenge muscles, unless you're trying to power lift or something of that sort, which I'm not, immensely helpful. But the other thing that I learned from you that, combined with that was this idea that certain muscles will grow better and get stronger much more easily, maybe even will recover better because of our ability to contract them really hard. And this what I call the Cavaliere test, which is at least if I could paraphrase, so for instance, if I can, it's always the bicep, isn't it? Let's use the calf or the bicep. If you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit, like it almost feels like a cramp or a cramp, where you can flex your calf to the point where it really cramps up a little bit, almost feels like it's nodding up, that's a pretty good indication that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well under load if you're doing the movement properly. And that's the feeling to actually aim for each repetition, maybe even throughout the repetition. For me, this completely transformed my results. And this was, I think maybe five/six years ago that I first heard this from you, body parts that for me, lagged behind, that I thought maybe genetically weren't going to work for me, immediately just started growing, right? And I was getting stronger and stronger, and I thought this is really something so much so that I've dedicated a portion of my research along with, in collaboration with another group to try and understand what's happening in these upper motor neurons in the brain that can engage the muscles even more. And that it's not just about progressive overload or putting a pump into the muscle. That it's really this mind muscle connection is a real thing when it comes to predicting results and that you can get better at it. So forgive me if we're paraphrasing your incredible content around this, it made a tremendous difference for me and a number of other people that have passed that along to. But what can you, first of all, how did you arrive at that? Because we hear about the mind-muscle connection, but I really heard it first from you. How did you arrive at this kind of cramp test, the Cavaliere test as I'll call it? It's always weird when people name things after themselves in science, but other scientists can name things. So there is now officially the Cavaliere test, is whether or not you can cramp the muscle in the absence of load, just flexing it to the point where it hurts a little bit. That would be a good indication that you could grow that muscle well. How did you come up with this? - I mean, honestly, it's something that made sense to me, because during my workouts, even as a young kid just starting out, I always wanted to know what is it working? A lot of people ask that question more so than you think, like, what is this supposed to work? And a lot, I don't know if you've ever noticed, but like when people ask that question, if they're being trained by a trainer, and the trainer's saying, well, just do this, do this exercise and they'll show you how to do it. But then they'll say, but what is it supposed to work? Where am I supposed to feel this, right? People, did they just inherently ask that question? A lot of people will. I was one of those that did that, and I asked that question. Not because I knew what I was doing, but just because I don't know, I wanted to know what was supposed to be doing the work. Once you do that, and you start to seek that out, and say, okay, well, the bicep is what's supposed to be doing the work, then I want to make sure the bicep's doing the work. So then I would just sort of really like tweak the movement to make it do more work or feel more uncomfortable, or get it stronger contraction, knowing if that's supposed to do the job, it wasn't until PT school that I'm learning, oh, well, the flexion of the elbow is the brachial and the bias and the bias' responsible for supination. You started to, I learned other components of it, but all I wanted to know was to bring my arm up in a curl, what is supposed to do the job? So I would seek out ways to make that happen better. And when I was able to do that, I could feel the stronger contraction. And I just, I don't know what it, I just, I was no visionary, I just felt like I knew that that was going to be better for me if the muscle I was trying to grow was being stressed more effectively. So when I was attempting to do this across different exercises, I would notice that what I could do potentially on a curl where my arm is up, where you asking me to flex my bicep that position, I couldn't do if I was doing a concentration curl, or I couldn't carry over to a cable curl, and that shouldn't really change, 'cause the function is still largely the same, there's still elbow flexion, there's still supination, why am I not able to do it there? And that's when it sort of clued into me that like, your mind-muscle connection on not just your mind with one muscle, but on every exercise matters, and it varies from exercise to exercise. And even if you don't gain muscle size from doing that, although I think it's very hard not to, especially if you're not used to doing that, there's a term I like to call muscularity, which is a difference, right? It's the level of sort of resting tone in the muscle. That improves dramatically. If you can learn how to just start to engage that muscle better, the muscularity, the resting tone of that muscle is harder, it's more at attention, it's more alive. And it's all driven from being able to connect better neurologically with the muscle that you're trying to train. I've talked about a lot in efficiency is really what you're trying to seek in movements when you're trying to create hypertrophy. When strength is your goal, efficiency of the movement is what you're looking for. You're looking to have muscles tied together and work well efficiently, the chest, the shoulders, the triceps, to get a bar off of your chest or in a bench press. You're not looking to make it a very inefficient leverages for your chest, to try to grow your chest in a bench press, you're trying to let the whole package come together for a greater output. But when you're trying to go and create muscle hypertrophy or even this muscularity that I talk about, you need to seek ways to make it feel more uncomfortable. If you don't feel the discomfort, then you're doing something wrong. And I struggle to this day on certain muscle groups to still do that, even knowing what I'm trying to work and knowing what the goal of everything I'm preaching here. It's very difficult for some muscles and for certain people to do this on certain muscles. But as you mentioned, practice does help. And the more you become consistent and deliberate with what you're trying to do, the more of a result you actually get. - It's couple of really couple of points I'd like to delve into further. First of all, my hunch was always that the muscle groups that grew most easily and that I could contract hardest without any- The first time I did the Cavaliere test, got 10 out 10. If we give it a 10 out of 10 scale. It could just like cinch, isolate those muscles, cinch them, grow them easily. I mean, there's certain body parts, I don't want to say which ones, 'cause it doesn't really matter, that I always felt like if I just did pushups, they would grow, and these muscles are far away from any of the muscles that are supposed to be involved in pushups, even though I like to think I'm doing pushups correctly. You'll tell me if I'm not. But some of that I think is genetic, and some of that has to do with the sports that I played when I was younger. So I swam, I played soccer, I skateboard. And then later I boxed. And so the muscles involved in those sports were always very easy to engage later when I went into the gym. So I guess perhaps a call to parents, having kids do a lot of dynamic activity, seems like it might be a good idea. The other thing is this issue of muscularity. I am so glad you brought that up. There are, I have to imagine a large number of listeners who don't want to get bigger. They don't want to take up a larger clothing size. They don't want to take up more space. In fact, some of them would like to take up less space, but they want that quality that you're describing, which is that, oftentimes you hear it more in the, here I'm stereotyping a bit, but with kindness. You hear from women who haven't weight trained, they say, I don't want to get big, often. Sometimes they do, but most women that I've helped weight train or talked to about weight train say, I don't want to get big, I want to get toned. And I think what they're referring to is this quality of muscularity. - A hundred percent, - This idea that at resting or at close to rest, or anytime someone reaches out and grabs a glass, that the muscles almost look like they're kind of twitching underneath the skin. And yet it's Saran wrap skin anatomy chart type skin. So this thing of muscularity, or resting tone, has a physiological basis, I think it's how readily the nerves are communicating with the muscles. And you're saying that by learning to engage the muscles more actively, the resting tone or muscularity can improve. Have you seen that both in men and women? - Yeah, oh yeah. - And do you think this is something that takes upkeep, maintenance, or that once you develop that in a muscle, you can just kind of let it coast. - I think like everything at key, it requires upkeep, you know, user lose it, I do believe firmly, but like I think that the development of the connections is going to be harder than the maintenance of the connection. As I said, I still struggle to this day for myself with unnamed muscle groups, they also,- But there's just certain areas that are harder for your brain for whatever reason to just develop that connection at that type of level to create that extra strong contraction. But I think that with proper dedication and focus, and then I'll go right out and say, calves is one of the areas that I don't necessarily have a great connection with, and I also obviously must not care so much 'cause I don't put in the time and effort to create that connection as I could. So I think what might happen is, you know yeah, there could be a struggle there, but then with struggle comes disinterest, 'cause you're like, well screw it, I'm a calf knot and I'm not going to do anything about it. So I think if you put the required effort in, and the time and repetitions that you will develop that, and once you do develop it, it's going to stick around a lot longer than it would had you not invested any time into it at all, not requiring as much of that. But I mean, I don't know, like you mentioned, now when you train, it's like, you're just, this is just part of how you train now, like you're going hard, you're trying to really forcefully contract. You're not just moving the weight, I say from point A to point B, but you're like trying to contract the weight through that range. That is a mindset that I try to put into what everything I'm doing, unless of course I'm focused on a strength exercise where I'm just trying to lift a greater amount and use all the muscles together. But when the goal is inefficiency for hypertrophy, I am really trying to create that contraction, and it's just part of my training. So I guess that for consistency's sake, as long as I'm training is happening. If I get away from training that it's not happening at all, but you know, even there, I probably another embarrassing admission probably, will mindfully do it throughout the day, even with no weight in my hand, in certain muscle groups, whether it be my abs or my arm or my shoulders or something, I'm doing something just to sort of engage the muscles. And I do think that some of that sort of inane practice actually helps by the time you go back into the gym. You just kind of keep that connection going. - Well, it certainly obeys all the rules of neuroplasticity. You know the fire together wired together mantra, which is the words of my colleague, Carla Shatz, hold true for all aspects of neural function, including nerve to muscle. So these flexing throughout the day or the deliberate isolation of contracting a muscle throughout the day is without question engaging neuroplasticity. And if you were to do fewer those repetitions, you're going to get less engagement of the nerve to muscle connection. I can say this with a smile and with confidence because, one of the first things all neuroscience students learn is about the neuromuscular junction, 'cause it's a really simple example of where the more times the nerve fires and gets the muscle to contract, the stronger that connection get, receptors are brought there, et cetera, et cetera, there's a whole bunch of mechanisms for a topic of another podcast. But basically that practice throughout the day makes total sense and works. - Yeah, and there's no, believe me, there's no science behind that in terms of the application of it. You do it when, you catch yourself doing it from time to time. But it is definitely something that's easily done discreetly and you wind up doing. I actually, I think in a recent video when I did talk about growing your arms by just improving the connection. Not that that connection itself is applying any load or resistance that's significant to create overload for growth, but it's the development of that connection that I then take back with me into the gym at a more effective level that takes every exercise I do there and makes it more effective. - That's like sharpening the blade, so to speak. Yeah, certainly obeys the laws of nerve to muscle physiology. Wanted to just touch on a couple of things. If the goal is to challenge muscles, and one is dividing their body into, let's say, a three or four day a week split or so, or maybe up to six, how do you know when a muscle is ready to be challenged again? Again, I've heard, okay, every 48 hours is protein synthesis increases and then we'll get into this and then it drops off. But frankly, if I train my legs hard, I can get stronger from workout to workout, or at least better in some way, workout to workout, leg workout to leg workout, training them once every five to eight days. If I train them more often, I get worse. So whatever that 48 hour to 72 hour thing is, somehow my legs don't obey that, or maybe something else is wrong with me, but I'm sure there are many things else wrong with me, but how do you assess recovery at the local level, meaning at the level of the muscles, so we'll talk about soreness, and getting better, stronger, more repetitions, et cetera? And then at the systemic level, the level of the nervous system. And I'd love for you to tell us about the tool that, again, I learned from you, which is actually using a physical scale, because it turns out that, will let you tell what the tool is, but that tool is also actively being used for assessing cognitive decline, and cognitive maintenance, and cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's and dementia. - That makes total sense. Makes total sense. So regarding the first part of the question, how would you kind of dictate when a muscle's recovered? So I do think that what you're experiencing is totally real, that different muscles recover at different rates. And I've always been so fascinated by this concept. I've talked about internally with my team, but like, I feel like what we really need the holy grail to training, is going to be when we're able to crack the code on an individual basis, when a muscle is recovered, and that is going to dictate its training schedule. And the fact that you might have a bicep that could be trained via a pulling workout, a regular bicep dedicated workout, forget to split at the moment. You may have a bicep that's able to be trained, that can be trained again the next day. And then the next day, and then maybe you need a day off after that. But like, that can vary from person to person for sure, and it can vary from muscle to muscle in that person over the course of time as you mentioned, 'cause the systemic recovery is going to impact all those muscles anyway, but let's say you're systemically recovering, every muscle itself is going to have a recovery rate. And I think what's fascinating is that, when you talked about before we like to train in this week, or we have, like the way our mind looks at training, well, if that was the case with the biceps, that bicep is a slave to the rest of your training split. Where it's like, well, why does it have to be also at the end of every eighth day or whatever, when it might respond better to something much more frequently? And your legs are also being thrown into that mix. There's a Mike Menzer concept where he's like, train one set and be done for 14 days. I mean, there's such variability between muscle groups and you're linking them all together. I think that coming back and using muscle soreness as a guideline for that, is one of the only tools we have in terms of the local level. You know we don't really have, being able to measure, let's say CPK levels inside of a muscle would be amazing, at a local level to see how recovered that muscle is, but that becomes fairly invasive, at least to my knowledge, it becomes fairly invasive. So what are our tools? I mean, I think that at the basic level, that's the one that most people can relate to and easily identify, and then use that as a guideline. And if you're training when you're really sore, it's probably not a great idea. And it's probably a good indication that that muscle's not recovered, but at least hearing what you and I are saying here might be a comfort to the person to say, yeah, it is possible that it's not recovered. Just because 48 hours is the recommendation. And just because research points to muscle protein synthesis needing a restimulation, well, maybe not, maybe you're not necessarily there yet. For that muscle that you're not there yet. So it's all really interesting stuff, but as far as the systemic recovery, I think there's a lot of ways people talk about resting heart rate measured in the morning, all different kinds of core temperature and things like that that might become altered in a state of non recovery. But grip strength is very much tied to performance and recovery. And when I was at the Mets, we used to actually take grip strength measurements as a baseline in spring training all the time. Now, obviously as a baseball player, you're gripping a bat, you're pitcher, you're gripping a ball like- Having good grip strength is important, so if you've noticed somebody had a very weak grip, it's just a good focal point of a specialized training component for the... - Would you use this every day with those guys? - No, we would do, in spring training, we do sort of a baseline entry level measurement. And then we would measure it throughout the season, maybe once every two weeks or three weeks. And the idea there was to manage the recover, measure the recovery. But I just gave it away, to determine overall recovery, your grip strength is pretty highly correlated. So we have found that with one of those scales, those old fashioned bathroom scales at like the bathroom and beyond, or whatever you can get, which by the way, almost impossible, I believe Jesse and I were searching for the last scale to put in that video. And we almost couldn't find one, 'cause everything is like digital and everything. I'm looking at the old fashioned dial controls. - It's like old Macintosh computers. There's a huge market for them and old phones. Kids keep your phones now. In 30 years, the lame phone now will be worth a lot of money. - It'll be worth a lot. So, I wound up finding one, and it's a great tool for just squeezing the scale with your hands and seeing what type of output you could get. And I think we all can relate to this when you just visualize, imagine the last time you were sick, or that when you, or just try this, the next time you wake up in the morning, when you first wake up in the morning, you're still groggy. Try to squeeze your hand, try to make a fist as hard as you can. You're going to sit there angry at your fist because it won't contract as hard as you know it can. You don't have the ability to just create the output. And that is because in that state, you're still sleepy, you're still fatigued, you're not even awake the whole level at this point. Well, that is still an actual phenomenon that happens that, a lack of recovery, or lack of wakefulness, or whatever you want to say is going to lead to a decreased output there. So when you start to measure that on a daily basis, you can get a pretty good sense of where you're at. And I think when people start to see a drop off of 10% or so, or even greater of their grip output, you really should skip the gym that day. Because I don't think there's much you're going to do there that's going to be that beneficial, even if it is the day to train legs or whatever day it is. - I love this tool, it's simple, it's low cost, if you can find such a scale. I guess you could also find one of those grippers that, and you could do this in a very non quantitative way, but better would be a scale where you could actually measure how hard you can squeeze this thing at a given time of day. It draws to mind, just a little neuroscience factor, in the world of circadian neurobiology, one of the consistent findings is that in the middle of your nighttime, they'll wake people up and they'll say, do this test. In the laboratory they use a different apparatus, but it's essentially the same thing. And in the middle of the night grip strength is very, very low. And mid-morning, grip strength is high, and as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon, grip strength goes higher and higher and higher, and then it drops off. There's this circadian rhythm and grip temperature. So you probably want to do this at more or less the same time each day if you're going to use it. But it I think it's brilliant in its simplicity and it's directness to these upper motor neurons, 'cause that's really what it's assessing your ability. Again, it's about the ability to contract the muscles hard. If you can't do that, you're not going to get an effective workout. - Yeah, and they also, I mean, there certainly are more sophisticated tools too. As PT, we have hand grip dynamometers, we can measure one side at a time too. I'm not really, I'm getting a little bit blinded by the fact that both hands are squeezing into that scale and I don't get really a left right comparison. But even at that level, that could give you a little bit more detail, but that comes with a cost, those are pretty expensive devices. But if it's, listen, if you were an athlete, the $200, $300 it cost to have one of those would be well worth the added investment. - And I'm sure some of our listeners will want one too, 'cause there are a lot of tech geeks out there, not tech industry geeks, but people who like tech gear. What's it called again? - It's a hand grip dynamometer. - Hand grip dynamometer. - Dynamometer. Said by Jeff with a great East Coast accent, and by me in a terrible botched at West Coast version. Thank you, well, I'll put that in the show notes also. Now I think recovery is key, we always hear about sleep. You grow when you sleep and incidentally your brain, you stimulate learning when you're awake obviously, but the reordering of neural connections happens in sleep. This is why sleep is the way to get smarter, provided you're also doing the learning part. The sleep's the way to get stronger provided you're also doing the training part. You've had some really, you've put out interesting content over the years in terms of even sleep position. One of the major changes that I made to my sleep behavior is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the bed. And I'll tell you, this had a profound impact on several things. First of all, my feet have always been the bane of my existence, broke them a bunch skateboarding. And I noticed when I'd run, I'd get shin splints. And then I started to notice that my feet sort of, you're the PT, they were kind of floppy, as if I was pointing my toes slightly all the time at rest. And I realized that based on listening to you previously, that my sheets were wrapped tight, not hotel tight. - Right. - What their thing in the hotels. And I started releasing the sheets at the end of the bed, and I also started doing some tibialis work. Front of Shin's work essentially, changed everything. My back pain from running my shin splints disappeared, my posture improved, although my audience will tell me that it still needs improvement. They're always five or 10 people that- I've actually had chairs sent to our mailing address. Very nice chairs, right? So I'm trying there. But this is fascinating, right? The position that one sleeps in, I fortunately have never had any shoulder issues knock on wood, but maybe you could just talk to us a little bit about sleep and sleep position for sake of waking position and movement. 'Cause this, I think is a very unique and very powerful way to think about sleep. This podcast has done a lot of episodes about keeping the room cool, getting sunlight in your eyes, et cetera, how to get into sleep. But you've talked about physically, what positions might be better to sleep in. So please, please enrich us. - I mean, first of all, some people's opinions of that type of content is that, you sleep in the position that's most comfortable so you ensure that you're sleeping. Oh great, I understand that we all want to sleep, that's the goal when we put our head on the pillow, is to actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning and not know what the hell happened, unless you had a dream. But you know beyond that, there are certainly physical components to sleep. That is why a lot of times people will wake up and say like that you can incur pretty serious injuries in sleep. People will wake up and have like a shoulder that did not bother them at all, be humming the next day or even for weeks after, because of the one sleep position they put themselves in, in a prolonged way. And they happened to have a deep sleep, even through the discomfort. That can do actually some damage. So it's understandable that the body can incur some strain and stress if you're sleeping in the wrong way. One of the things I say right off the bat is, sleeping on your stomach just doesn't really have many benefits. You're putting yourself into a position that is, depending upon the orientation of your mattress or how many pillows you're using, but you're basically putting yourselves into excessive extension of the lumbar spine, which for most people, isn't very good, if you're a disc patient, I guess that might be helpful, for relocating the disc. But I mean, for the most part, your hands are then usually not at your sides, but they're up under your arms, so you've got them into sort of internal rotation up over elevation in your head. It's just not a great position. You also have to crank your neck for one side or the other in order to breathe, or you're going to your face down, straight into the pillow. So I would skip that one. And there's some people that are total belly sleepers. And I would just say, listen, I don't think that is the most helpful, long term way for you to sleep. Try to adopt a different position. Sleeping on your side oftentimes is, is also brought along with that, the legs knees coming up towards the chest, prolonged hip flexion. Listen, we're doing enough of that during the day. - What we're doing right now. - We don't need to do another 10 hours or eight hours or something at night like that. And it just is reinforcing, and as we said too, let's say you trained that day, you're just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight. Where the body is healing and trying to create some changes in your body. One of the reasons why I recommend stretching or static stretching prior to going to bed, a lot of people don't really want to do it at that point, 'cause it could take 10 minutes, 5-10 minutes, depending upon how many muscles you have to stretch. But it's good to sort of try to establish just longer length temporarily prior to going into a state where you're going to be not moving and recovering and creating new changes in the muscle. So, that kind of, I don't say it doesn't rule out the side sleeper. The side sleeper could be very, very helpful for somebody that has apnea or other conditions. So again, it's not an all or nothing approach, but it's something that you need to pay attention to. When you are on your back, like you were talking about and your feet are wedged underneath a tight sheets at the end of the bed. And most of us, unless we consciously are pulling them up, don't prefer our beds to have really loose sheets at the end of the bed. - It's hard to make the bed in the morning. - So it's like you you're going to want to have them tight. Well, I'm saying as you experienced, you're going to have these prolonged plant reflection, that's going to likely lead to shorter calves over time because you're lacking all that length for that long period of time that you could have if you just loosened up the sheets and allowed your feet to just hang out where they are. Now, the resting position of the ankle is not endorse reflection, it's going to be still in some plain reflection, but not being driven down and pulled down into that position. And I think what happens actually is people who get uncomfortable that way, even in their sleep will shift away from that by turning either onto their side of their stomach. So there's definitely an impact of the body position and sleep in figuring out the best way that you can still sleep of course, and get your rest, but have a mindful eye towards what it's doing to your body and choose the one that's least abrasive to your body is the way you should go. - That's terrific, and again, it's really helped me and I'm a big believer based on good science out of Stanford and elsewhere that as much as we can be nasal breathers in sleep, we probably should be. I don't know if you've done any content yet about taping the mouth shut with some medical tape, but you know the benefits of nasal breathing in sleep are pretty tremendous, but it takes a little bit of training for people to do, and the training is very simple. It's a little piece of medical tape. So again, a topic for another time. I'm glad you mentioned stretching, I was going to ask about stretching a little bit later, but let's talk about stretching. When's the best time to stretch for particular types of results? And maybe you could define some of the different types of stretching. So you just mentioned a little bit of, what you call it, light stretching or? I'm completely naive here on stretching. So let me just say, I can think of stretching where I hold the stretch and really try and \"lengthen\" in air quotes folks, I don't want the PTs jumping all over. I don't know what it is, but nutrition and the PTs online are really, they've got pitchforks in both hands. Academics... - That's a recent evolution, I think. And not the nutrition as much, but the PTs have become a little bit angry these days. - I see, well, I always say with feelings of powerlessness comes aggression. Remember that folks. So in any case, they're stretching where I'm trying to consciously \"lengthen,\" again in air quotes, the muscle I'm not yanking on the limb or bobbing up and down. Maybe you could define the different types of stretching for people, maybe give us some rough guidelines about what or not to do if cold or warm, before training, after training, et cetera. - So, yeah, there's obviously there's a lot of different types of stretching that could get even to P and F stretching and things that are a little bit more niche. But in general, the two basic forms of stretching are active stretching and passive stretching, and your dynamic work. And your passive stretching is done with the goal of trying to create an increase in the flexibility of the muscle. So whether you're actually increasing the length of that muscle, more so what you're doing is increasing the- or decreasing the resistance of that muscle to want to stay at a certain level of flexibility. So when we can sort of take the breaks off and allow that muscle to allow us more range of motion, we're inherently increasing flexibility without necessarily having to increase the length of that muscle. That is usually done at a time far away from your workout, because they have shown where this type of stretching done prior to an activity, and it could be like a structured activity like lifting, or it could be a little bit less structured, like competing in a sport in a spontaneous type way, that there is a period of recalibration that is needed after doing this, because you're disrupting the length tension relationship of the muscle that causes you to not necessarily be able to rely on these, I've talked about before, stored motor engrams in your mind in terms of, this is the pattern for how I swing a golf club, say. And now introducing a little bit of flexibility, or added flexibility, or range, because of the stretching I did before, it takes maybe a whole or two or three to match up again. Oh, this is what he's trying to do, that golf swinging thing that I remembered again, like it's not remembering that every component, like I have to bend my right wrist back 10 degrees, and then I have to bend my elbow and I have to break, like your body stores these patterns for motor efficiency. And when I have to start matching up that stored pattern with what's feeling new because of the increased range, I can impair performance. And again, it could happen even in a gym workout where you're talking about your first, second set, third set, where maybe the repercussions aren't as big, 'cause I'll just do a few extra sets. But in performance, if you screw up your first three rounds, you're playing on a PJ tour and you shoot your six over after three, you're done. So I think it matters there. As far as the dynamic, so we relegate that as I mentioned, sort of towards the end of the day when it's not going to impact performance, but even maybe have the additional benefit of creating the feeling of length or the increase or decrease in resistance to this length at a time when I know my body is going to try to tend to heal and heal shorter, never longer, but heal shorter. So if I can introduce a little bit of that extra length or decreased resistance to that length, it's a better time to do it. So I think it promotes a better recovery. If I want to... - Sorry to interrupt, but so stretching later in the day, because I'm intrigued by this concept of heal shorter. So part of the healing and recovery process means the shortening of the muscles. This is the tensing up in sleep. - Yes, yeah. - Could you elaborate just a bit on that and then sorry to break your flow, but then to continue... - No, just basically, what's been shown is that, when the repair process, muscular repair from, let's say strength training during the day, the repair process usually results in a muscle that is slightly shorter rather than increased in length. It's just, muscles prefer to sort of ratchet their way down into that contraction, and then maintain that more comfortable length tension relationship. So when you're sleeping, it tends to air on the side of shorter rather than longer, when ideally we don't really want that. We want to maintain as much of that length because with more length, we actually have more leverage. That muscle has more leverage to contract. If it was all the way contracted, you really can't obviously we know generate much force in a muscle that's already maximally contracted. So I think we want to do something that we, whatever we can, whatever little weapons we have in our arsenal that could allow us to do this prior to sleep. And again, it's just making it a conscious choice to do it at a time of the day that makes a little bit more sense. Dynamic stretching is really not done for that purpose of trying to create any type of feeling of act or increasing the potential length as you said of the muscle, but more so the readiness of the muscle to perform. And increasing exploring the ends of that range of motion in a more dynamic way so you're not hanging out there in disrupting that length tension relationship but just sort of touching the ends of those barriers so that when you feel movement again, it feels looser, it feels more ready. And obviously at the same time warming up blood flow, all the benefits we get from just warming up in general. So like that's the series you've probably seen a bunch of times but like leg swings and butt kicks and lunge, walking lunges and all types of- - Toe touches. - Toe touches, all those kind of drills, those active stretching drills or lunging with rotations for the upper body to try to get some of the thoracic spine involved too. Those are the drills that people will do prior to training that are both excitatory in terms of just the nervous system but also helpful for just the general warm up the body 'cause the blood flow. But from a muscle readiness standpoint not impairing the performance while at the same time exploring the increased ranges 'cause as you know the first toe touch you do is not as high as the last toe touch you do. - For me it doesn't even include the toe. - The shin touch. - The touch attempt. - So like those are going to improve with each subsequent rep and I think that's what people actually, when you can see those, those actual changes from rep one to rep seven, you just feel ready, you feel more alert and ready to go in your workout. So the dynamic type of stretching and I mentioned earlier on what I've had to do to sort of increase my warm up focus. I think that's more of what I try to do these days. I try to be a little bit more alert to the fact that, my body's not ready. When I was working with Antonio Brown I remember like he would spend 20 minutes, 30 minutes on all dynamic work. And I've never seen anybody spend that long on their dynamic work. But like he said, he just didn't feel right and ready to go unless he did a lot of that. And I mean his dynamic stretching routine would be a workout for most everybody. And it's crazy how much he did. - These pro athletes are amazing. And you've had the great fortune of working with and improving their abilities. But I can only imagine 'cause I also imagine he is pretty strong in the gym also. - I mean, it always amazes me the guys that make it to that level no matter what sport they do. They're so gifted in everything. Like David Wright used to make me laugh all the time with the Mets because no matter what I, Ping pong, like anything because of his hand-eye coordination. Like anything great at. Jump rope. I remember he hadn't done a lot of jump rope and I think jump rope's one of the best things you could do from a conditioning standpoint. It's actually fairly interesting, it's not just, it's not too harsh on the joints even though it's a ballistic move and he wasn't- I have to admit, if he listens to this, he's going to want to kill me, but I was better at him at jump roping. One of the only things I could do. And then I gave him about five days and he completely blew me out of the water to the point where I could never keep up with him anymore. He made it look effortless. It's like that's where the athlete in someone comes out. No matter what they pick up, they're good at it. And I think that when you see guys like this in the gym like their strength levels tend to be pretty damn good and their abilities, their coordination, their everything just tends to sort of be good at that level. And it sort of amazes me. Why those guys can go pick up a golf club and go shoot 72 and having never really played. They're just naturally good at whatever they do. - Yeah, I have a couple, I'm smiling 'cause I have a couple really close friends who did a number of years some several decades in the SEAL teams. And I don't know that their skill level at everything is so high as you're describing for athletes but their level of competitiveness is beyond. I ocean swam with one, there's no chance that I'm going to right out swim Pat ever, ever. He actually goes back and forth sometimes just to check up on me, which I appreciate. Thank you Pat. I haven't drowned yet. But in addition to that, we could play horseshoes and it's like this switch that just flips on, like he's going to murder me. Of course he's a very nice guy, right? In general, they tend to be very nice. But the level of competitiveness is kind of unreal. They're selected for it. - They're trying to beat themselves they're not even trying to beat you. - That's right, I'm not even in the competition. - You're not even there. - Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Now I won't feel so bad or worse. It's true, it's a remarkable thing. I'm glad you mentioned jump roping. I used to skip rope for warmup for boxing, like three minute rounds or something like that. But I'm glad you brought it up because skipping rope is something that obviously has a cardiovascular component, there's the conditioning component, there's timing and it is kind of interesting, right? It's frustrating when you don't get it especially when it whips you on the air if you're using a proper rope. I'm just curious if you could just give us a quick skipping rope 101. Do you like to see people jumping with both feet and toes? We'll link to a video if there was one and I missed it. Do you like to see people doing high knees? Do you like people basically like shuffling? You want to see people doing double Dutch? What do you want to see people doing over time? - All of the above maybe not the double Dutch, but all of the above. I mean, I think that's the cool thing about it, right? Like once we sort of master the skill 'cause for all of us, that first jump with the two feet going together is a challenge. 'Cause you just got to time that rope, you got to time your jump and then we get bored as we often do as humans, we get bored with what we can do and we want to take on new challenges so then it becomes one leg at a time or then it becomes side to side hops, right? All of those things are beneficial I believe neurologically to enhancing the ability to do the skill as a whole but also just because I'm such a believer in training in all three planes. So like just doing straight up and down versus now I can do frontal plane side to side motion and then I can even do small little twists or core screws you call them. It requires a different, you would know more better than I do that it requires different neurological patterns to be able to coordinate that because you're changing the orientation of your body in space. So it's not just them changing the exercise but I'm changing how my body interprets that exercise because what's happening to my body in space. So I love whatever people wind up doing, but I am amazed there are people, I just started following this young woman on Instagram who is like, I'll give her a plug out, I think it's like @anna.skips or something and she is ridiculous. Like I watch her and I'm like mesmerized at what she can do with the rope. It's like is an extremely athletic endeavor believe when it gets to be at that level and the speed and the precision and the- I think one of the goals that you want to be able to have is to where you're feeling as if you're almost effortlessly dancing without a rope. Like where you're just bouncing off of the ball of your foot. And it's an important skill to learn too whether you go back to run or even even jog, right? Just like more casual running, learning how to land is so important. One of the drills that people should try is like, try to jump on your heels. So just stand up, pull your toes off the ground, right? And just jump from your heels and land on your heels. You'll feel it in your jaw. You'll literally feel your jaw rattle when you land on your heels. There is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels. Meantime, a lot of people land on their heels a lot when they run and you're just, your body's not built to absorb the forces like the ball of your foot could. It's really built as a spring. And the foot is a, to me as a physical therapist, the foot has always been one of the most amazing, you talk about having bad feet I have flat feet it looks like I got flippers if I took my shoes off. Like I'm wearing scuba fins. There is no- There is no adaptability of that foot to the surface. When it's completely caved and flattened like that, the job of the foot is to be a adaptable. Well, maybe there is some adaptability because it's so floppy, but at the same time at some point that critical junction when you're going to then step through and you need to be able to push off the foot has to actually changes in the midfoot itself to become a rigid lever is what they call it. You're going from a mobile adapter to a rigid lever. That rigid lever literally locks up the metatarsal joint to become solid so that you can push off of it with leverage. If you lack that capability, all those stresses that are supposed to be born by the foot, go up into the ankle, into the knee, into the hip, into the low back. So learning how to land and start to train your body to experience ground reaction forces the right way is so critical to all other function and all other disability of the kinetic chain and jumping rope is like one of the best ways to learn how to do that. - Great. I own a jump rope I love doing it in the morning while I get sunlight in my eyes. It's actually a protocol I picked up from Tim Ferris who mentioned 'cause listeners in my podcast know I'm like a broken record with get sunlight in your eyes even through cloud cover it's just sets your sleep rhythms and your waking rhythms of yada yada on and on. But sometimes it'd be kind of boring for people and I want to get them off their phone. So jumping rope is also just a great way to wake up. So jumping rope can be the cardio workout, the 15, 30 minutes. - Definitely. And there's sort of that hybrid that we were talking about before of like, you're not necessarily dropping down to the ground and doing burpees, but I just look at it as a more athletic endeavor because of the coordination involved than just simply walking or jogging. - Yeah, and it's not much of equipment requirement. Very minimal cost. You could even use a rope or something if you... - We even instruct people they could use no rope and just pretend and just move the arms, right? - Truly zero cost. - You're never going to hit the rope which is good but at the same time, So you're never going to know if you're doing it wrong, but at least you can move through that and get the same benefits through the feet. - I love it, I love it. I told myself before sitting down with you today that I wasn't going to focus on specific exercises because there's such a wealth of incredible content that you put out there that people could just put into YouTube or elsewhere and arrive at the proper way to do a chin or a dip, for whatever purpose. But there's one exercise and one particular motion that I'd like to discuss for a moment because I believe that learning about this cautionary note from you is one of the reasons that I've maintained steady training for 30 years with no major injury knock on wood and that's the upright row. One thing that whether you weight train or not. - Do we censor this podcast? I mean censoring, do we beep this out or not? - I do. Do you get beef about this? - No. You know what, we always get beef in any social media platform where we're put out. But like, no, I guess some, I get some from it, but I'm fully prepared to defend myself. - But here's the reason for asking about this. I never really cared much for upright rows it's not an exercise I tend to do. But one thing that's apparent in all my colleagues, in every child I see, in every adult I see is that almost everybody is in inward rotation now. So folks think if you stay, I think I learned this from you also, if you stand up straight and then you just point your thumbs out, like a thumbs up but your hands are down you're pointing your thumbs straight out, ideally they would go straight out. Most people the thumbs are going to be pointing toward one another because most people are starting to look somewhere between a non human primate and a melted candle. Bent at the hips, et cetera, from too much sitting, we're all sitting, we're in an inward rotation, but I learned from you that the upright row compromises some important aspects of our shoulder mechanics and could be actually sort of a dangerous movement in some ways. I'm sure there's a safe way for people to do it. But so I've always made it a point now on the basis of this advice to A, not do upright rows, but I wasn't doing them before but to really strive for external rotation on things like bench dips, on a number of different things. Whenever I can I try and go into external rotation provided that without looking like an idiot walking around with my palms facing outward. Please tell us about internal external rotation. The upright row is one aspect of that, but why this is so important not just for weight training, but as in terms of posture and mechanics and not looking like a melted candle or partially melted candle. - I actually love it. I'm happy to talk about it cause I love the shoulder as a joint. I think PTs tend to fall in love with certain areas and the shoulder is one of the cool areas for me, it's like the foot is but like, the shoulder has the most mobility in the body of any joint, but it's also got the least stability, right? There's always that trade off of mobility and stability. So your stability comes from certain muscle groups and 101 is that the only muscle group that actually externally rotates the shoulder is going to be the rotator cuff, okay. And unless you are devoted to training through external rotation and exercises that are going to externally rotate the shoulder, you're not training that function. And it's so easy for us in everyday life especially those that aren't training to not ever really undergo any of those stresses that could be beneficial to counteracting what happens freely and naturally, which is internal rotation. So when you think about the imbalance created just by nature and how we live our lives, internal rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation. So you need to address it. And the reason why you need to address it is because you need to normalize those biomechanics to the shoulder if you want their long term health. And one of the functions of the shoulder is to raise our arm up over our head. And if we do that from an internally rotated position, we're going to have a higher likelihood of creating stress inside that joint. Funny thing is I talked about before my PT brethren who can be somewhat angry these days, I don't know what happened, but fairly angry. They want to discredit the existence of something like shoulder impingement, which I don't know how, I mean, certain studies, look, we both all read studies and studies will say one thing one day and potentially conflict entirely in a different direction. Some studies will point to the non-existence of a shoulder impingement. Meanwhile, we have thankfully digital motion x-rays that will literally show the impingement occur in real time, in real function. And that's one of the limitations I'm off on a tangent here, but like those types of x-rays or that type of fluoroscopy that we have nowadays, like gives us such insight that we never had before 'cause we're taking static x-rays of someone laying down on a table. Well, I want to see what happens when you actually raise my arm up over my head in function and the tools now exist to do that. We see the problems occurring because in order to get normal mechanics and free up the joint maximally inside you need to externally rotate as you raise the arm up. So if your muscles aren't firing and they're not necessarily as strong as the internal rotation bias that pulls them in, you're asking for trouble every time you do that. Well, this exercise is literally putting you in elevation and internal rotation. And if you were to walk into a PT office and someone said, \"I think he's got impingement, will you diagnose him?\" There's a test called a Hawkins Kennedy Test. And I would put you in the position I know we're not visible at this point through the podcast, but I'll put you in this position here where I have your arm elevated and your hand pretty much under your chin pushing downward on that to create that internal shoulder rotation. Pretty much the exact position that we're in when we're holding a bar in an upright row. Some will say, well, just don't go so high going up to the level of the chest, but you're still in this internally rotated position. The thing that I think frustrates me the most about the exercise is that I have an alternative and the alternative does the same thing in terms of helping the muscles grow by simply fixing the biomechanics of the exercise by just allowing the hands to go higher than the elbows. So instead of the elbows being higher than the hand which drives you into internal rotation, if the elbow is lower than the hand, the hand being higher here, I'm in external rotation. And I could do something called a high pull and still get the same abduction of the arm and still get the same benefits of the shoulders, the delts and the traps without having to undergo any of the stresses that would come from the somewhat awkward movement of an upright row. - And for those listening, we'll put a link to a short clip of what this looks like. But basically what Jeff is doing and tell me if I'm describing this incorrectly or correctly. Jeff is taking your two thumbs and pointing behind you, so elbows up kind of near the chin and pointing behind you like, oh, headed that way. Like somebody directing the airplane, like come back, come back and back. I forget what they call that. I think it's called semaphorin, is the action of like where they direct the planes or something the flags or whatever. Someone will, of course tell me I'm wrong about that too, which is why I say these things because I like being told what the correct answer is. In any case, so this replaces the upright row and probably does a number of other important things as well. - Well, again, listen, without naming names or programs or anything like that. When I got involved in, when I got involved in Athlean-X, when I first my online presence, there was a very, very, very popular program that was out there that I just for fun I wanted a as a PT, is the nerdy things we do, but I wanted to evaluate the workout structure. And I went and I looked at every rep over the course of a week. And there was something like 890 repetitions or something done and zero of them were dedicated external rotation in the shoulder. So if you think about it, I mean, again, it was a very popular program that was done by a lot of people. There was no focus at all, no dedicated focus towards creating a balance to an action that is so predominant. And remember, it's not just because we sit with bad posture, but the fact that our chest can internally rotate, our latch can internally rotate, there's like muscle, other big muscles that participate in things that we do every day that will further internally rotate the shoulder. The only weapons we have for external rotation are those little rotator cuff muscles and three of them actually three of the four. And the job is to sort of actively and consciously train them through really the boring exercises, right? Like you've seen them with the band, you anchor a band to a pole, you stand with the band in the opposite hand. So if it's anchored to the pole on my left side I've got the band on my right side and you see people where they kind of rotate their hand towards the back. Again, kind of what you were saying but at a lower elevation taking the back of my hand and trying to point it to somebody behind me. Well, that is one of the ways to train the muscle. It's just a one function of the shoulder, external rotation of the shoulder and you need to do it. And again, it's not that if somebody was doing more external rotation work could they absorb the upright row better? Probably, because as they elevated the arm, they probably have a little bit more of a contribution from the rotator cuff to what one of the functions is to centralize the head of the humorous inside of the glenoid, the capsule. So as it rises up, it stays central as opposed to migrating up because the deltoid likes to pull up. So if the rotator cuff has some ability to counteract the upward pull of a del then it can maintain a more healthy relationship with overhead movement. So just realizing that that function is only gained through doing these exercises, we would probably dedicate more time there, the upright row might be better absorbed by that person 'cause they have a little bit more strength. But again, why? Because if you have an exercise that does the same thing for what you're trying to do muscularly, to build the muscles that it affects, why wouldn't you just do it where you can still see actually pick up more repetitions of external rotation? So you're getting none of the harm all of the benefits. I see zero reason to ever do the upright row and people will argue, this is the way they argue that, I've done this for 30 years and I've never hurt myself. And I always say yet, yet. Like, listen, the goal is to not hurt yourself ever. So even if you, it's sort of like the championship game. You might play the game of your life, but if you lose you lost. And when you get into the end of the record books, you still lost. So even if you had the game in your life you lost, I don't care if you do it for 30 years, no pain, you're still doing it and there's no pain I'm giving you an option that's going to give you the same results in the exercise that you're seeking. That's why you're doing the exercise without the possibility of having the the bad outcome come from it. So I get a little bit defensive of the move, but I feel like it's like, why would you do that? - No, it makes me say, being able to train for a long period of time and feel good. I'm proud to say and I don't have the kind of genetics where like we don't have a lot of impressive athletes in our family tree or anything. It's some fit individuals some less fit individuals, but I really believe it's about putting in the work consistently over time. And the more often you can wake up not in pain the better. And so I think that being in external rotation as often as possible is good. This is actually a good friend who's a yoga teacher told me this is also a problem with the yogis, all the downward dog stuff. For those listening, you can think of inward rotation as like thumbs down. Just think thumbs down and rotation isn't bad but less thumbs down more thumbs up is external rotation. So for those just listening, maybe that gives a visual. The more exercise you can do in external rotation the better it seems on average. I'd love to chat with you just a little bit more about biomechanics, and this is a personal thing that again, your content really helped solve for me. One is I thought I had lower back pain, that I had sciatica so badly that on a few trips Work trips years ago when I was doing a lot more international travel. I mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes. I mean like excruciating pain. I didn't want to take medication, I didn't want to do back surgery. In the end, turns out it wasn't a back injury at all. And one of the things that helped fix it was this just learning about this thing called the medial glute. And you had a video that said fixed back pain and then you quite accurately say that some back pain isn't really about the back at all. And had me do an exercise or allowed me to try an exercise where I lay on my side and essentially pointing my toe down the top toe down, almost like pointing a toe down and then would slowly lift the leg up while pointing the toe down. Maybe I got it... - No, you got it good. - And then holding that, and there's a muscle that sort of sits at the top of the glute it kind of peaks out every once in a while. You can feel it there with your thumb, which is I think you had push back on it. A bit creating that mind muscle link again and there with proprioception, the actual feeling of a muscle literally with a limb, we know based on the neural circuits for movement, that that enhances the contractibility of a muscle. So like if you touch your bicep, you literally can contract it more more strongly. And this makes total sense based on neuromuscular physiology. So had me do that repeatedly. And I started doing that in my hotel room and the pain started to disappear. And then it came back again the afternoon so I did it again in the afternoon. So this is something I did for three or four days and lo and behold a back pain's gone. I handed this off to my father because he like me has a slightly lower right shoulder. I think that our gate is probably thrown off by this. It's probably a genetic thing, who knows. He handed off to somebody. It turns out that we don't suffer from back pain and in fact, now I don't suffer from any pain because I was doing this exercise which I think is helping my medial glute. Two reasons why I raised this. One, I know a lot of guys who have this right side sciatica 'cause people keep the wallet there is one idea or left side sciatica. There are a lot of people male and female who think they have back pain when they don't actually have back pain. And the other thing is that is a general question about biomechanics or statement about biomechanics. I had of a feeling that a lot of what people think is back pain or knee pain or neck pain or headache or shoulder pain is actually the consequence of something that's happening above or below that site of pain. And this is a whole landscape of stuff related to PT and recovery and pain management. But maybe if you could just educate us a bit on this and why this works, what is the medial glute? Why did it make my so-called back pain disappear? And how should people think about pain? And I'd like to use this as a segue to get into a little bit deeper discussion about pain and recovery. - Sure. So this is definitely like a big cornucopia PT stuff here, but like and this is what I love. So first of all, that video, it's my proudest video that I have. And the reason being is that it's helped so many people. Like we get comments on that video every day. I don't even know how many views it's got now, 30 some what million. - We will link to it. - There's a lot of views. And quite honestly, it was a little bit of an afterthought video in terms of it's origin. I think that that day maybe Jesse was having some problems or something like that, a little bit of low back pain and I showed him and it helped right away and he was like, well, we can make a video on it 'cause this will help people. Not everybody, if you have a real disc problem, it's not going to help because you're not changing the structural problem that's there. But as you said, a lot of people don't and even disc issues a lot of them are non-operative. So you'd want to try these things first. As far as what you're sort of experienced sometimes as that glute medias really tightens down and that's again, from poor biomechanics up and down the kinetic chain, it can actually press on the sciatic nerve and give you what they call a pseudo sciatica. Where it's not like you're making it up, it's not like you're not feeling that pain over that same sciatic distribution, but it's not caused from a disc, it's not caused from something mechanical there, it's caused by the fact that this gluteus has posturely become a problem for you or weak because you don't train it and you need to address it. So, unlike any other muscle in the body, there are common trigger points in common areas where the muscle will become tightened or painful or spasmed and you can basically apply pressure to these areas and then sort of thread that muscle through the pressure by pushing down through there and then contracting the muscle which is why you go through that action of, I think we call it toast stabber, but like stabbing down and lifting up and stabbing down and lifting up. Taking that glute medias through its function. So it's basically kind of working underneath the downward pressure of the finger and that tends to help you to almost need out what might be that trigger point. And that's why people can see immediate relief there because once the trigger point lets go, it feels like, and that's what the comments are in that video. Like my God, I literally, I couldn't walk, I've been on my hotel floor, I did this and I'm fixed. And meanwhile then it could come back because your body is like, well, I like being more like this. This is how I've been ingrained to be. So it might come back but then when you do another round of it and another round of it and then finally it starts to say, all right, I'm not going to do that anymore. It kind of eases up and you can relieve yourself of those trigger points. You could do that up and down the back. There's other people that get that and that sort of inside their shoulder blade, that same type of cramping in another area. But once that takes place, well, then the job that I think people have is like become educated that the glute medias is different than the glute maximus. Like their functions are different. You have to work on not just extending the hip but also abduction of the hip. External rotation of the hip, same thing as in the shoulder. And this actually segues nicely into what, into the whole concept you were talking about. Like the body is like a mirror image. The hip is like the shoulder, right? The ankle is the wrist. The foot is the hand. The knee is the elbow, they're two hinge joints, they function that way. Well, with the shoulder, you've got that mobility that comes from having all that freedom of motion but the stability is lacking. Well, the same thing with the hip, like you've got mobility, but if you don't fully stabilize it by training all the muscles of the hip and if you don't strengthen the external rotation of the hip, then you're going to have issues. Like it's not biomechanically going to work the same way. If you think of the body as a series of bands pulling in different directions at different levels of tension, you're being pulled into one direction or the other just by the balance of tension from one weak area to one dominantly tight area. And you need to make sure that you can sort of balance this out in order to eliminate some of the adaptations and compensations that happen. So what I say, when we look at sort of the body as a whole, most often wherever you're feeling the pain is absolutely not to blame. There's not to blame. It is somewhere above or below as you hint to that. You're talking about, the knee is my favorite example of it. Whenever you have knee pain, patella tendonitis which I have forever. I've had bad, bad cases of tendonitis where squatting is very difficult for me. It's not the knee, the knee is literally a hinge joint that there's minor rotation capabilities in the knee but it's a hinge joint. And it's being impacted by the hip and the ankle and the foot, as I said before, how critical the foot is. If you thought of the knee being like the middle of a train track, where the femur down your thigh and your shin down below your knee, where the train track, well, what would happen if the foot collapses at the bottom? All of a sudden that train track on the bottom gets torqued just a little bit. Well, who's going to feel that the most, the area where it's torquing, which is at the knee. So the stresses are going to be felt there meanwhile the problem is the foot or the problem is the ankle. People that are chronic ankle sprainers are almost always going to wind up having back pain because the ankle sprain causes weakness in mal adaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain. Because now once I distort the ankle and the shin, now the knee is trying to maintain its ability to hinge smoothly. So it toques on the femur to do that. Well, the femur is now inside the hip joint pulling on the pelvis and the pelvis is out of whack. It's really is fascinating. Like it's one of my favorite things about how the body works is like how interconnected it is and how one little thing somewhere causes repercussion somewhere else. And the easiest way to find out what your problem is, is to say, okay, I know where my symptom is, but I got to find someone who can help me find the source somewhere else, because it is going to be usually either above or below. Mostly, usually below 'cause it usually translates up the kinetic chain. But usually it's going to be below where the real source is. So people with low back pain usually have hip issues weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues, it's almost always below. When you get into really high performance athletics though, it almost works the other way. Like where we have pitchers, who can't, I'm always fascinated by guys that have Tommy John issues in their elbow, right? Pitchers. Like if you can't externally rotate the shoulder that we talked about, again, the ability to get your shoulder back into external rotation. Well, your arm has to get to a certain position for release of the baseball. And if it can't get there, if you can't externally rotate the shoulder to get there then the elbow has to sort of torque more in order to allow the arm to get back further. And it will try to take some of that motion from a joint that's not really, again, it is the hinge joint, really capable of doing that. So it starts to stress that media level ligament to get a little bit further back because the shoulder's not working and that just ultimately places strain on the elbow. So when you see a guy that has pain that floats around, a pitcher that floats around their arm, all that is is sort of this balance of compensation. Once his elbow starts hurting, then he can't get the range from the elbow, so he tries to dig a little bit further back into external rotation and then the rotator cuff gets inflamed and then he feels that's inflamed, and by the way, during that time period, it takes some of the strain off the elbow so the elbow feels better. Then he decides, okay, now I got the extra rotation, but I'm getting too much of that so now he starts straining the elbow again and then keeps going through this cycle. So your body is very smart and it's going to compensate every single time. It's going to find the compensation but there's no guarantee that that compensation doesn't leave you with a whole host of other issues. - Yeah, it's fascinating. In another lifetime, I would've gone and been a PT although it sounds like the community among PTs online... - I don't know what they, listen, we're good people but it's like... - Yeah, scientists and neuroscientists can get into pretty intense battles. Coming from the academic community, the etiquette is so different online because I would say, I think in person people would probably behave a bit differently. - They shake your hand and say, hello. - Yeah, they shake your hand and say, hello. And there's also, look, I'll just be very direct about this. There are a lot of people online for whom their only content is pointing out the misunderstandings or alleged flaws of other people. It's like the bulk of their identity. Which to me is sort of a sad existence but there's always more to gain by thinking about what's possible, and what's new and what's good. But teach their own demise or win. - I mean questioning what's out there is healthy, it's normal, is great, it actually sparks conversation. But as you said, some people's existence is solely to find things to nag about and not actually with the goal being to advance anything, but rather just to. - Yeah, in the world of science being skeptical but not cynical is encouraged. But I always say that the longer that somebody's in a career path that's certainly in science or medicine and they realize how hard it is to do various studies. Once they publish a few studies, generally they sort of get a better understanding of how the various things are done. In any case, along the lines of pain and pain relief and misunderstandings about the origins of pain in the body, one of the great tools that I picked up from your content which is benefit I know a huge number of people is I think I used to hold weights sometimes in the tips of my fingers as opposed to in the meat or the palm of my hands. And I had elbow pain. And I always thought that, I felt it most on tricep exercises and pushing exercise and I thought I was doing those exercises wrong. Turns out toward the end of my pull ups or my bicep work, I was letting the weight or the bar drift into my fingertips. And the mere shift to making sure that my knuckles were well over the bar or that the weight was really in the meat of my palms has completely ameliorated that for reasons that you point out and maybe you could just share with us why that is you have this kind of finger pull exercise. Usually when someone says, pull my finger, it's like a bad middle school or elementary school joke... - Yeah, we would say push your finger. - [Andrew] Right, right. - You know this is fascinating. This is because it just shows again how intricate the body is and how responsive or over responsive it can be to something so little. And what you're talking about is that when you grip a bar whether it be through a curl or whether it be through- And this is mostly pulling exercises because the tendency for the bar is going to be to fall out of your hand not like with a pushing exercise where it's kind of you're pushing your hand into the bar. So on a bench press say. That bar can drift just by gravity doing its thing or fatigue of the hand grip strength. Can start to drift further away towards the distal digits. Through those last couple knuckles that we have on our hands. And though our hand can still hold it there, the muscles are not equipped to handle those types of loads. And that can start at a very, I'm not going to say light, but like it could start at dumbbell weight. 40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds or something depending upon their overall strength levels. But then when you start to apply it to something like your body weight with a chin up, right? 'Cause that's natural for the bar to somewhat kind of float down towards your fingertips. And it actually is a little bit easier to perform the exercise with that sort of like false script little hook grip at the end because you're not going to engage the forearms into the exercise, you're not going to start pulling down. But at the same time while it could help you to perform them better by getting the back more activated, if you have weakness in these muscles. 'Cause it's not a thing that happens to every, it's not one of those upright road type things where I think this is happening to everybody. This is happening to people that have these inherent weaknesses in these muscles. You or haven't done enough of the gripping in the meat of the hand for long enough but it starts to put that stress on these muscles that are ill-equipped to do this and to handle this and it starts to it's particularly on that fourth finger, which is part of the muscle we call the FDS, a flexor digitorum that is just too much for it to handle. And that comes all the way down and meets right at the media level. Right on that spot that you can say feels like someone's knifing you right in the middle in that medial level. And medial epicondylitis or they call it golfers elbow is something that a lot of us deal with in the gym. It's one of the most common inflammatory conditions people get from the gym and it all comes from this positioning of the dumbbell or barbell or hand on a pull-up bar over time. So the easiest thing to do is just grip deeper so that what you're doing is you're using more leverage from the palm to encapsulate the bar or the dumbbell or whatever and you're not putting that pressure really distally right on that last digit because that's where that FDS muscle is most strained. So you just almost eliminating that from the equation. And it's one of those exercises that the load can exceed its capacity pretty quickly. So that like, maybe it's only capable of handling 30 pounds and then when you're doing a chin up and it goes and it drifts so far that it's now you say you're a 200 pound guy you've got let's say 100 pounds through one arm and 100 pounds, this is simplified math that obviously is offset by other muscles, but 100 pounds to one arm 100 pounds to the arm, 100 pounds off of a muscle that can handle 30 is not going to take many repetitions to strain it and you're going to feel that maybe by the time that a set's over or certainly by the time that workout's over or the next day you wake up and you've got that notable stabbing pain. Whenever someone feels that the best thing would be to determine, okay, what exercises would I do that were pulling and where the bar could have drifted deeper or further from the meat of my palm into my fingers and figure out a way to deepen that grip. When that happens though, the best thing to do with most of these inflammatory conditions is not do any of that stuff for a little while. Not ever, just for a little while. There's always things that you can do around it. I'm not saying ever do I say, like, don't go to the gym or don't find something you can do, but I'm saying that particular exercise that you feel the pain on while you're doing it, never a smart idea to do that exercise when it's inflamed. If you are doing exercise and it hurts, you probably shouldn't do the exercise because another reason for the variability of exercise is there's so many other options that you can do that will train similar muscles or even the same motion and not cause that stress. So, I mean, a cable curl would be much easier to do that on than let's say a chin up where you don't have the control over the weight like you do by moving a pin on a stack. So I think that is a common thing that people find and the best thing to do is just figure out how deep you gripping in that bar. You're going to find that, oh my God, I didn't realize that because it was just. Even though you might start a set in a good position and then it drifts away as you go. - I think that's what was happening to me and I'm very conscious of this now. Again, for me, I haven't had this elbow pain at all. - [Jeff] That's great. - Very fortunate. So again, a debt of gratitude to your never- I thought there was some wrong in my elbow, basically. And I thought maybe it was tennis elbow I don't even play tennis. There you go. Other aspects of recovery and variables for recovery. I think you and I both put out content about the use of cold and I think we can summarize it by saying, yeah, it does seem like cold water immersion immediately after hypertrophy restrains workouts might be a problem, but a cold shower is probably not a problem. What about heat? Do you personally use heat and cold saunas, hot baths, hot compresses. And by you, I mean you personally and athletes that you coach or people that you coach, what are your thoughts on the use of heat and or cold? - Well, I think it might just be an inherited practice from the days of trainers of since babe Ruth. But we in baseball we used a lot of cold following performance. Just because the idea would be there is some especially pitchers, there is some inflammation that is abnormal. The arm is not really designed to do what they do especially at the speed that they move it and everything else. So we would use ice as a pretty standard practice after that. But not a lot of heat and use a lot of heat and of course from the recovery or the healing aspect that actually becomes rather personal preference they've found now after let's say the first 12 to 24 hours where you're really trying to control inflammation of what might be an injury. But then it can kind of shift the personal preference because the heat can bring blood to the area also and then the cold has its sort of antiinflammatory effects. So like there's a balance between which one's working better for you. So there's really no standard anymore for heat or cold in that way. But from a standpoint of like post-workout healthy status, I haven't used much heat or cold in terms of what we do. We cover the topic of the cold showers and to try to dispel the myth of the, even people saying that there's giant testosterone releases and you know all kinds of stuff that. Listen, we hear all kinds of things 'cause people want- I think the idea of just turning the water cold and being in it for 30 seconds and then all of a sudden magically growing three times your size is intriguing for a lot of people and that's why they ask these questions 'cause they're like, well, that would be a hell of a lot easier than going to the gym and training hard. But like, I'm always fascinated by some of the stuff that you talked about. In fact, we started to talk about some of the stuff in terms of cooling and what it can do on performance and that was like there's some untapped territory there that I think you're finding out about. - Yeah, what would be fun would be to bring the CoolMitt technology from Stanford. This is Craig Heller, my colleague Craig Heller's lab at Stanford's done really important and amazing work in this area but then it moved on to some other things. He's also working on down syndrome and he works on a number of other really important topics that scientists often do. But I have access to this CoolMitt technology, no relationship to the company, by the way, would love to come out to your facility and we can do the blind type studies. - Like the blue blocker test. - Yeah, exactly, exactly. And see how that goes in with somebody as advanced trained as you that's probably the best thing to do. So content for the future. Yeah, I think heat and cold are kind of staples in the PT world and it does seem like people use them slightly differently but they are kind of the macro nutrients of recovery there along with sleep. I do have a question about precision of record keeping. Do you keep a training journal? Do you recommend people keep training journals? Are you neurotically fixed to cadence of movement and are you looking at the, do you have a buzzer going off when it's 90 seconds rest. Is it 90 seconds rest? I confess I have my slow workouts and my faster workouts. And they scale with whether or not I'm training heavier with longer rest. Or whether or not maybe midway through a workout, I'll shift over to doing higher repetition, lower rest. This is kind of my crude way of keeping time. But I'm not- Will be just to kind of watch the clock. But I'm not neurotically fixed to the buzzer nor am I on social media during my workouts. Which is actually a way to really improve workouts is to just not be on social media. - I can't claim that I'm not guilty of that. Sometimes I am on social media but sometimes I'm trying to post something. - Well, that's different, it's your profession. It's your profession. - But I mean, I'm not necessarily chained to some sort of protocol in terms of how I do. I think by this point I've been doing this a long time and not only is it something that I've done for a long time, but it's a passion of mine, it's something I really enjoy. So I probably inherently have the ability to stick to these guidelines in terms of rest time to know what I lifted. Even six months ago on a lift and how it felt without journaling it. But I recognize the value it has to a lot of people, it goes back to that whole my muscle connection idea that we talked about in the beginning. Like there's a lack of awareness for all aspects of training. And especially maybe it isn't like your interest level. We're talking you and I from a position of interest. Like this is what we do. We enjoy just how our bodies work and understanding how they work. Some people don't care, they just want the end result. But journaling and keeping track of that raises awareness to where like, oh my God, I have been on Instagram for the last seven minutes and I was supposed to be back at my next set in 90 seconds. Like there is a training effect of that. Like if you're training for a metabolic overload, you've blown that opportunity because you haven't, your rest time very important to that protocol, working as it should. If you were training for strength, maybe the extra few minutes doesn't matter so much when you get back under the bar you might find, you might find that it's a better response for your body to rest even longer than you've been told three, four minutes, five minutes. And so that way maybe it helps, but I think that anything you can do to increase your awareness of your performance and also give yourself some objective goal. Whenever we have an objective goal, it's a lot easier to actually obtain it. When you're just there to get a pump and you're just there to lift how you feel that day, you have to be incredibly disciplined in all other aspects of your workout in order to make that effective. And I've done that too. I've actually been able to do that too, but again, the level of repetitions I've accumulated over the course of my life in the amount that I read about this stuff. I think I'm able to get away with that, but I think more often than not what I'm doing is not journaling but journaling in my head exactly what I think people should be doing and that is getting a specific effect from what you're trying to do. It's not so haphazard. You want to get a specific effect just like any other experiment that you're doing. If you're doing an experiment on your own body with your own weight, which to me is one of the most empowering things someone can ever do. When they get bitten by the bug for exercising and in training and I like to use the word training rather than exercise 'cause there's a purpose behind it. But when they get bitten by that training bug and they start to see actual changes and results, you know how empowering that is 'cause we can't change, we can't really control that many things in our life, unfortunately. And if there's some things that happen to us that we really wish never happened. And those are not something that we can do anything about, but this is one thing that we can do our best to. We can't avoid disease entirely, we can't predict when we're going to die, we can't do those things, but we can certainly decide to show up into the gym that day and get a workout in or go for a run or do something and in by doing that, you're giving yourself I think, a better chance at a higher quality of life. So anything you could do to increase your awareness of it and keep you on track with that is like I'm endorsing fully. - Couldn't agree more, I could not agree more. There is a topic it's sort of a dreaded topic, but I think it's an important one and that's the topic of nutrition. And rather they get into specific meal programs, which would take take hours and probably wouldn't even manage to scratch the surface even with hours. We could talk about principles around nutrition. What are sort of the themes that you think people should keep in mind when thinking about how to eat generally and pre-training and post-training are two particularly sensitive times for most, or at times that people want to know a lot about. What should they eat before training or can they train fasted? What should they eat afterwards? But just in general, what do you think are some axioms of nutrition that really hold. And I ask this 'cause, not because there's a lot of debate about this, but because you've been around this space a long time and you've seen what works for you obviously but for other people too. What tends to work? What tends not to work? And how should we think about nutrition? - I mean, look, you've touched on it a bit but like, nutrition can be a touchy subject for people. And I understand where that comes from. I've talked about before that there's a dogmatic tendency to nutrition, and there's a reason for it because it's an area that people struggle with more than anything else. And the reason why people struggle with nutrition is because the commitment is extremely high. You could start a workout program and actually get to the gym three to five times a week. That's five hours based on how you and I were discussing it before. Well, what about the other 23 hours of each of those days. There's opportunity to eat incorrectly or unhealthily every one of those hours. People wake up in the middle of the night to go eat. Like there are things that you can do that can cause amazing amounts of damage to your longevity in the 23 hours not the 1 hour, the 23 hours. So when people finally figure out a way to make that work for them, it's very passionate and I understand their passion. I do like I've put out, so my approach, my approach is like, I've always been sort of a low sugar, lower fat guy. I've made the mistake of going no fat years ago and I paid for it. I was like in college and back in the day we were the same age. We read all the magazines and that was what we had. We didn't have an internet then. So we were reading magazines and the recommended path was to go low fat. It helps you to become hypo caloric very easily because the density of the calories in a gram of fat versus a gram of carbohydrates or protein is nine versus four for the carbs and protein. So if you're cutting out grams of fat on a daily basis, you're quickly cutting out calories that allows you to get leaner. Well, of course as everything, I mean, if little is good, then a lot is better. So I would cut all of them out or almost all of them and at the age of 22, 21, I'm like standing at a stop up at University of Connecticut waiting for the tram to come and bring me to campus. And I couldn't even open my eyes because the light was blinding to me. It was normal sunlight. It was blinding to me, the photosensitivity I had learning later on after a few more courses that I took there in biology how necessary fat was for the development of healthy cells. I realized what was going on and not to mention other stuff skin was bad, hair was falling out, all kinds of stuff. So I think that the approach to decreasing fat so it's not excessive, because again how calorically dense it could be in having lower sugar. I'm a firm believer in sugar is really pretty toxic and something that we would all do better getting rid of a lot of it. That is the best approach for, I believe, again, in my opinion, personally, for the overall big picture. Because though the people can take exclusionary approaches to nutrition and taking carbs out or eating only fats and proteins, or again, I'm not saying it doesn't work for you. And if it's the first thing that actually allowed you to gain control of your nutrition to the point where you actually saw results and got to a healthier weight, then I always say, then do it, then do it. But just make sure it's something you can do forever and doesn't bring upon other repercussions. But I think that non exclusionary approaches to diets are the most sustainable for the rest of your life. And all I'm interested in from a nutrition standpoint is something that's sustainable. So when I preach what I preach, I've been doing this since I was 15, 14. People say like, how's he get so ripped? How's he get? I have been doing this for four- For how many years? 30 years. - Eating clean low sugar. - Yeah, 30 years. And the beginning it was a slow shift I had to make where I was like, I went from the worst diet in the whole world. Even when I was 14 years old, my breakfast was, I talked about this so many times, but Entenmann's I would eat Entenmann's donuts and... - Those long rod- - Yeah, the long [indistinct] - They even took the hole out of the donut. - [Jeff] Exactly. Why would you delete the middle of the donut? - The crumb donut there. I would eat donuts... - I can taste it in my- I don't like sugar very much but over the years I've lost my appetite for sugar. But as you talk about the entiments I can literally smell and taste the frosting. And to me now it's disgusting but back then it might have been appetizing. - You would probably have like really good information on this, but like my ability to actually remember, they've said smell is very evoking of memories, right? - So smell is unlike the other senses because there's a direct line literally from our sense of smell to the memory centers of the brain. It doesn't have to go through any intermediate stations. - Okay, so my ability to actually recall exact taste of all the stuff that I used to love is enough to satisfy me to not engage in those things now. As crazy as that is. Like I almost get my feel through remembering 'cause of these strong senses of memory of what it was like, 'cause oh, that used to taste so good. Okay, that's good, I had it so... - Fantastic. We know the neuromodulator there, that's dopamine. Your ability to get the dopamine release from the thought of some things. Most people when they get that dopamine release, it causes a triggering of the desire for more. - [Jeff] for more. - Right, people think of dopamine as pleasure. Dopamine, there's a book, great book called, \"The Molecule of More.\" I didn't write the book unfortunately, but someone else did and it's a great book and it's really about how dopamine we think it's about pleasure, but it establishes craving. So you're able to satisfy that and it is a very adaptive thing for you because you are indeed very lean and that's one of your kind of hallmark things as a professional who does this in the public space that's important when people are out there talking about getting lean and you look at them and you're like, maybe you need to do the protocols. It's a huge advantage but yeah, I think that, it sounds like you've cultivated practices around avoiding certain things. - Yes. But not avoiding certain things that I think are easily avoided if you realize that there, I think that we have enough science and literature out there to prove that the altered path is a better path. You know what I mean? Like I feel like if I was just doing it because I wanted to be lean, I'm not quite sure it would've held for so long. - Well and we have a guest that whose episode has been recorded for this podcast who runs an eating disorder clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. Medical school, studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD and he will go on record in obesity, and he will go on record saying that these very highly palatable processed high sugar foods of the sort that we're talking about, donuts and so forth, that they are actually dangerous, right? That there are elements of the way that they engage neural circuitry. He's a neurosurgeon that reshape the brain in dangerous ways. And those are his words and... - Yeah and it's not just entiments. I mean, I think not just entiments right? Yeah, they're coming after us, with what, with donuts. - [Jeff] Exactly. - Yeah, they can't catch us. - [Jeff] True, true. - In any case. So in terms of what you do eat, how do you structure that in terms of, when you look down at a plate you've done this, described this before, but I think it's just a beautifully simple description 'cause I think a lot of people don't want to do calorie counting and all this and how should people think about what to eat? - So yeah, I have like what I call a plate method and it's just simple 'cause it works for me. And again, if you're struggling with real eating issues, these mechanisms become admittedly less effective because you're having maybe you have emotionally triggered eating and you can't stop at one plate. I mean that you could get the plate right but if the portions are out of control. - Plate has a dimensionality of height? - Or multiple plates like second and third plate. - Or fourth. - Like then all these things can be challenged but what I say is when you have your plate then you just simply look at it as like a clock. And if you just make a 9:20 on the clock, so one arm goes over to the 9 and one of the arms goes over to 20. Well, then you're basically... You're going to take the second largest portion of that 'cause you're going to make a line towards 12 o'clock too. And the largest portion is going to be your fibers carbohydrate. So that's the green vegetables, right? So whether it be broccoli or Brussels sprouts, or asparagus, or pick your favorites. Like those are the ones that give us a lot of the micronutrients we need, they're the ones that are generally accepted as more healthy and they're also going to provide the fiber that's going to be both beneficial in terms of its impact on insulin and also just through filling you up, right? And then I take the next largest portion of that and I devote that towards protein. And I think it's really important especially for anybody active, the more active you are the more you embark on trying to build muscle you're going to need to have protein in every meal. So I have that. And again, you know, here we're talking cleaner sources of protein. But like, you'll never find like boiled chicken on my plate. Like I ditched those days when I was 16 or 15 or 16, like I realized after reading those body building magazines that maybe the low fat thing stuck for too long, but the no fat thing stuck for too long, but the boiled chicken and a steam broccoli thing that ended quickly for me 'cause I really I'm not going to eat this forever. So I'll have some sort of fish or chicken but it'll be cooked in a way that's like it's got maybe some sauce on it or it's got some maybe it's tomato sauce. Anything to just make it a little bit more palatable and interesting without blowing the value of the meal. And then that last portion is where I put my starchy carbohydrates. And again, that's the part that some people will say exclude them entirely 'cause they're not healthy or they don't work for you or they're not beneficial long term. For me it's been a God sent. And I do think I'm like most people my body craves those carbohydrates. I choose things like sweet potatoes which is my favorite or I'll have rice or I'll have pasta. I'm Italian so I like pasta. And like I will have those things, I'm not excluding them, but I don't put them in the portions that you would generally find. My wife and I will go out and we'll go to the restaurant sometimes because we travel quite a bit or used to at least with baseball too. There's a cheesecake factory everywhere you went and I love cheesecake factory, but like the way they structure meals is it's all rice at the bottom, and a little bit of chicken on top. And I mean, it's a plateful of rice that you wouldn't find me make a plate that way. I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate to the starchy carbohydrate. And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility in terms of portion control 'cause those are the foods, again, probably dopamine driven that are most easily over eaten. I always ask the question, what's the last time you ate 10 chicken breasts at a meal? Like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three, but you could eat a whole hell of a lot of carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates because the they're just so satisfying and I think those triggers, as you said, to want more, like that's what happens, right? You just keep eating, even when you're feeling full, you want more. And that's the biggest danger to carbohydrate. So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them, then you can still enjoy them. If you can't develop that discipline for whatever reason, then maybe they do become something that you have to work yourself around or adopt a different eating style. And as I said, I'm never to the point where I'm not trying to be dogmatic in my approach. I'm always trying to say, this is how I do it and I'm a believer in it just like everyone else's believer in their method, but I'm open to the idea that something that works for you and gets you to a healthier weight and a sustainability, like that is good, that's good for me. Provided doesn't introduce other issues. - Something one can do consistently, that's something I picked up from you over the years. What can you do consistently? And for me, that also meant, when, and how can I eat? What can I eat consistently that will also allow me to be alert after lunch so I can actually get some work done. Or eat, I like to train fasted in the morning but I don't do any long term fasting. It just so happens that I'm fine doing water and caffeine in the morning and training in the morning and then I eat my first meal afterwards. But I get carbohydrates at night so my glycogen is restored. I think carbohydrates are wonderful. I just don't eat them in excess. So to me, I feel like when what you describe as a very rational literally balanced approach. And obviously there will be variations for people who are dealing with obesity or diabetes. I've got friends that are on the pure carnivore thing, I have friends that are vegan and it's always impressive to me when somebody can stick to anything consistently except when they're sticking to just poor behavior. 'Cause there's nothing impressive about that. Well, I think that's very helpful because I think there's,- For the typical listener of this podcast, the online content that people see, the battles are very confusing. They're distracting. Because people really think, oh, that there's a right way and a wrong way and it sounds like the way that one can eat consistently over time that's healthy. Certainly fewer processed and sugary foods, I think almost everybody agrees there. - Yeah, almost everyone agrees on that, right? So I think it's calorie manipulation through some other method. So even intermittent fasting, like you said, like that could be, it's for people that are grazers. Like if you are a grazer and your real problem is portion control over the course of the day, but you can respond to a rule that says, no, you're eating between here and here, that you can obey that rule. Well, you're not going to be able to graze during the times that you might be doing additional damage. So sure there's other hormonal benefits that people will talk about from that approach. But from a longevity standpoint and habit forming standpoint, if it's fixing the habit that you're breaking too often by eating throughout whenever you feel like you walk by food, it's good and it works. And again, if people can, will tell you you can probably eat whatever you want to eat as long as you're eating within that window. But I think the more responsible people who are practitioners of that will say, no, you still want to avoid processed sugar and things like that. And that's just a mechanism of eating not really a diet. But like it's I think that people- I hate to be as like as basic as it sounds with that but it's for the exact reason that if it it's that 23 hour day phenomenon that it's like, you said you're impressed, it is impressive. It's so hard to control all of our behaviors and food being one of the hardest thing. One of the biggest temptations for people. You got to learn how to control that for so long and then do it day after day after day, whatever that mechanism is that works for you is impressive and I'm a believer in it. I think that's how I feel. I just feel like the people need to be able to be given some reigns to be able to find what works for them. - Well, I love to eat and one of the beauties of weight training is I feel like I can eat plenty for my age and I'm not as lean as you are, but I'm happy with where I'm at. I could always do better. With each year actually I'm getting better probably because I'm eating cleaner. Probably 'cause I also have someone to cook for me now. And we like... I have that too. - We like healthy food and so I'm very fortunate. I don't think we have any packaged food in our home. We even started making sauerkraut at home, I don't make it. I mean she makes it. - My wife actually she turned me on to a tip that I actually shared with the whole channel which was like, you can go to, we have a Stew Leonard's around our big grocery store chain around us and they have a catering department. And they're often used for catering big parties and big tubs of grilled chicken, but like really good grilled chicken. Again, not the boiled chicken and big tubs of sweet potatoes. And we'll get a bunch of those and she'll go over and she'll get them and then she'll sort of arrange them on plates and put the plates in and like, I'm okay with repetitive eating. I think more people are probably okay with repetitive eating than they think. I think that when you actually break down how many different breakfast variations, do you have? Three, two. - Two or three maximum. - So like, I think when the people do there's more variety for dinner probably but like even there you probably eat five different types of dinners over the course of a week or a month. Well, if you have that ability to identify the things that you like, and again, no plan is going to work if you're eating stuff you don't like. It's not going to work forever, nothing will, you have to really enjoy what you're eating. As long as these variations of this meal are something that you really enjoy and there are limited versions of them, the reproducibility of that is simple. It will take some time but if you're fortunate enough in our case to have somebody who can prepare it for you, now that's even part out of the equation. And it just makes it very simple. But I do think when you tally up all the costs of medical care that are spiked by having poor nutrition and you then offset that by what it might cost you to invest in a faster strategy like this catering trick or whatever it might be, you'd be best off figuring out a way to maybe reallocate some of your money to preparing this because how important it is to your long term health and longevity. If you can figure out your nutrition issues, if everyone listening to this podcast can figure out their nutrition issues, this whole world will be different. That is like one of the largest sources of disease, and pain and discomfort because people really struggle with nutrition. - Yeah, and it's a huge problem. I mean the obesity, it is an epidemic in this country. It's a very, very serious. Also a lot of highly processed foods are more expensive than healthier foods when you really break it down. Even the better sourced high quality foods are right there on par less than the processed foods for sure. But couple other questions as it relates to training. Because I think that one thing that a lot of people wonder about and maybe we could do this in kind of a true false method just to get through some of these... - 50/50 I'll get it right at least. - Exactly. Men and women should train differently. - The science of it will say false. And again, not to generalize, but kind of the point you touched on earlier today. I do find that casually interested women in training will migrate more towards certain types of fitness, like kickboxing, like dancing, like, - Low rest circuit type. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think, again, whatever is that you are going to engage in regularly is what you should do. Physiologically, no. And I think if we can get more women to feel more comfortable in the gym performing the same exercises and the same, in receiving the same strength training benefits and working on progressive overload and like, we've hit the holy grail. But I think that it's a big bridge that has to be gapped still because there's just some reality to- Listen, there are very, my wife is a perfect example of this living a very complicated busy life. We have two young boys they're twins and her attention and focus is there. And it's like, she doesn't do this for a living like I do. And if she can get a decent workout and she's happy, but she's not necessarily working on her deadlift PR. And so I think that that would help her and serve her in the long term to work on increasing her PRs, and different lifts and building her strength progressively. But in her life right now is not necessarily in the cards to have the time to focus on that. So would you then discourage this other thing that she might find interesting, like some boxing. There was a little, I don't remember the brand, but like one of those punchable boxing standup things and she enjoys it. Like anything to get you moving is going be preferable but I don't think that necessarily physiologically there's a difference. - You started weight training pretty young. - Yeah. I messed around with my brother 'cause he was older, he was four years older. So I was kind of messing around with weights probably 12 or 13 with a 5 pound dumbbell. - Yeah, you hear that young kids shouldn't work out with the weights. I don't know what the going standard is. Now they say, shuts down long bone growth or growth plates this sort of thing. You've got two young boys adorable kids by the way. - [Jeff] Thanks. - One of the things that is very heartwarming is to see you're in great shape, you're clearly extremely bright, you know your craft, you loved your craft. You work with Jesse, who we'll talk about as well. - [Jeff] That's great. - Which is great. There's a camaraderie there, having great teammates as part of a business or to work out with is just makes life better. Let's just be honest. I'm grateful to have great teammates for the podcast and my lab, of course, as well. But to see your boys and your dogs and the whole picture, I'm sure it has a lot of contours and complexity that we don't know about and shouldn't know about, but it's a beautiful picture. And will they weight train? I've seen the videos of one or both of them hanging from the bar. - These kids are naturals, I'm telling you that. - I wonder where they get it from. - I don't even encourage it. I'm not going to be the dad who's sitting there saying, let's go somewhere. We got our two days. I'm not going to do that but they have a natural interest in the gym. They just sometimes like to be out with daddy. So they'll come out there. I of the two of us, my wife and I will be the one who has a little bit more of a longer leash to let them explore things 'cause I was a dummy at times too and figured out best through the mistakes I made. - Through injury, right. In neuroscience we call that one trial learning. - There you go. These guys are going to be masters in one trial learning because you know, they'll go grab the bars of my, the handles of my jamer that's there 'cause it's at a lower level to them and they're swinging around they're doing pull-ups on it naturally uncoached nothing from me. One will walk up to a deadlift bar stand over it naturally never saw me do it, stands over there and just goes, he tries to pull it. So there's a definitely an inclination to liking the gym and I will fully support that. But of course body weight will be good for quite a while. - Yeah, so what age do you think is reasonable for kids to start exploring a non body weight training? - I think around 13. I think around 13. Once puberty, I think it's okay to start to. 'Cause there's so much, I even say for people that are like later in age who are just starting out, learn with your own body weight first, there's plenty of resistance to be had by learning how to command your body in space. So if you have never trained before, you're going to get very stimulated by doing lunging and reverse lunging, even learning some of the appropriate reception around movement through space. Pull-ups, chin ups. Pull-ups and chin ups are challenging for even people that have had 20, 30 years of experience in the gym. So there's a lot of stimulus to be had by body weight and jumping straight to dumbbells or barbells is actually doing yourself a disservice. You can learn better command of your body in space so that when you go back to the bigger lifts, you're going to have an easier time sort of progressively loading them and building up that foundation of strength. I'm not saying that you have to become a master calisthenics athlete before you can touch a barbell, that's not even true. I'm just saying there's so much capacity. Kids are going to be doing this anyway. And really just, if you look at general play, they are jumping, they are lunging, they are climbing, they are pulling like, that's what they do. I don't know where the avoidance of like structured training is for younger kids. Again, provided they're using body weight and maybe less ballistic movements or something like that. Things that are, or certainly overloaded movements. I think we should encourage kids to do more. There's a lot of obesity in kids on the rise also and that is incredibly disconcerting to me. So I think and I hope it doesn't come from the advice of some that say, well, wait until you're older to start doing something like. That's a way worse trade off than engaging in something smart now. - We used to get kicked out of the house when we were kids. - [Jeff] Totally. - My mom would kick us out. I had a huge pack of boys that lived on my street but we'd get kicked outside. Like literal, you're not allowed in, no television. But there were video games, of course but we were kicked out the house. We had to go play. For us it was skateboarding, soccer and then we'd find our trouble. But so post training nutrition. We're the same age, years ago I was sort of neurotic about the idea that I had to ingest a certain amount of carbohydrates and proteins within two hours then it was 90 minutes of training. I confess I get, if I train hard, so I'm talking about the resistance training not the running. But the resistance training, 60 to 90 minutes later, I'm really hungry. But there have been days when I just skip and then the hunger passes and then later I eat more. I might eat twice as much later that's just the way sometimes schedules go. But what are your thoughts in terms of the nutrition science, the training related effects of the post-training meal? Is it something that you try to get? Is it something you think people should pay attention to? - So that science has actually probably been the one that's changed the most in my lifetime, honestly, because, again, we're at the same age and I was falling for the same trap where I would really be focused on like, I'm risking speeding tickets driving home from the gym to make you sure I got an anabolic window. Like I did all that, I really did. But thankfully that's been sort of debunked in your body isn't just rushing through these certain periods of time to utilize the nutrients in our body, but are able to partition them and use them over a long, much greater duration. Up to now, they're saying, three to four hours after training, five hours after training, you could still see the benefits of replenishment. A lot of that is just I think there's a consistency element to it that just utilizing a post workout window or a post workout meal, even if it's within two hours or one hour is just integrating the habit of saying, listen, I just did this activity and now want to replenish some of what I lost the energy that I used to perform the exercises that I did. And just getting into the routine knowing that the engine is ultimately fed by what we put in it. And the concept of replenishing the fuel lost is still a concept that I think again, different in mechanism but still important in terms of fueling the overall performance. So the pre-workout period of time gives us a chance to actually have a longer window because if those nutrients are obtained pre-workout, it's not like they're gone in that hour that you've trained, they're still there and available for your body to use. So I think it's important to get one of the two right or at least make sure you're consistently having one or the two or you might risk going through all these periods of having no nutrition to support your efforts. Not only will your workouts potentially suffer in terms of the output, but then you're also not providing your body any ability to capitalize on an opportunity to feed it and refuel and recover. So I'm not very dogmatic about what specifically to eat pre or post workout. But I do think you should have protein surrounding your training, whether that be ahead of time or after. Protein could be a little bit hard to digest for some people. So if you do that pre-workout and then you're finding your workout is slogging because you don't feel good then suddenly you put that after your meal. But this whole concept of the urgency of time has thankfully been removed and we can just learn to eat a little bit more responsibly and drive more responsibly so we're not trying to rush home from the gym and risk killing people on the way. But I think it's great because I think that that was something that it just showcases a belief that people had for so long that has since been proven to be not that important. And there's a tip of the cap towards research in a good way where it's like, all right, I think we could all agree that this isn't necessarily true anymore. And look at yourself and say, oh my God, I did that so often. I bit that one hook line and sinker but then realize, okay, we could always make a change. And the good thing about nutrition is those changes can happen the very next time you go to eat and you'll start to see the benefits of that. So I'm not a big believer in that strict approach to pre or post-workout. I mean, even as far as pre-workout supplements, a lot of people don't take them. A lot of people don't like them, they don't take them, they don't like, they're not necessarily even being used as the new nutritive side of the pre-workout. They're just more used to fuel the workout. - For me it's water and some form of caffeine. - Yeah. I mean, it is whatever, again, I think it's important. I do think it's important to maintain a high level of output. So if your pre-work attrition requires a stimulant in order to help you do that or if your pre-work nutrition is causing you to have a harder time to train because you're feeling full or stomachache or something else, then that that's not achieving what you're trying to do. The ultimate goal is to still be able to perform at the highest level. So whatever your nutrition is required to allow you to still do that, that is probably the most important factor of all of it. - Great, I love the very clear and rational approach. Don't ingest anything right before your workout or near your workout that's going to make your workout worse. Yeah, and it's so simple and yet you don't hear this because I think people will think, oh, they must have a pre-workout they must have a post-workout. - No, again, even if the benefits that are to be had from whatever's being suggested is going to be easily offset by the fact that you can't perform at an output capable of driving any change. So that would pretty much negate the fact that you're not outweighing those benefits of whatever nutritive approach you took and is struggling through your workout. - For me, the best pre-workout is a good night's sleep, hydration, caffeine, and music. - Yeah, there you go. I mean, that's a simple formula. - It works. And then post what I do I do find I get quite hungry and want to eat quite a bit more and... - Well, that's a natural response the body's going to and most people want to do that and I think it should be fed. I work out as you know, again, a lot of my postings on Instagram will happen at 10 o'clock at night, 10:30 at night, 11 at night, 'cause I am actually training there and that's where I'm taking those little breaks in between sets to actually film or post something. But like, I then go inside and eat dinner. So I'm eating at 11 o'clock at night. It's not necessarily ideal, I'm not recommending that as a tool for anybody. I think it dispels one thing, I've never been a believer in Kenny carbs after six. - That makes no sense to me. - [Jeff] Zero sense. - Based on all the new, all the signs of metabolism that I've seen makes no sense. I think as long as you can, sort of like napping. I talked to Matt Walker, one of the great sleep researchers wrote why we sleep, et cetera, and has his own podcast about sleep, tremendous researcher, public communicator about sleep and he said, naps are fine provided they don't interrupt your ability to sleep well at night. Simple. Some people can sleep from eight to 9:00 PM and then go to bed at midnight and not a problem. Other people they take a 30 minute nap after lunch and they can't sleep at night. Same thing with- Caffeine's a little different because Matt would argue the architecture of sleep can be disrupted, et cetera. But if you can eat dinner late and eat carbohydrates late, I actually need carbohydrates at night in order to be able to sleep. Whenever I've done a low carbohydrate type regimen in the evening, I have a hard time falling asleep. I'm just too alert. And so I eat carbohydrates in the evening to restore glycogen but also in order to make sure that I can fall asleep. - I actually can, again obviously it's already late at night, by the time I'm done eating, but like I can fall asleep within 5, 10 minutes of finishing my meal. Because I do think that they have that same effect on me, but I'm never, I'm not bothered by the feeling of fullness. I'm not unable to sleep because of a feeling of fullness. But I do like the fact that I feel as if I'm at least replenishing what was lost through my hard training. And I do like to back it up with a dinner. I don't need to eat smaller amounts. Some people can't have that much. I will say after a hard leg workout, I don't have the same appetite that I do after let's say, an upper body workout. It can really disrupt my whole feeling of wellbeing. - You want to eat less after you train your legs? - [Jeff] I do, yeah. - Oh, wow, I'm the opposite. - No, 'cause I could feel sick to my stomach. - You're clearly training harder. I've seen the way you train, you do train very intensely. - Yeah. I think it's important. I mean, I think that... Again, it's that trade off between, if you're not going to train for a long period of time then you're going to want to train harder. And again, I actually feel like contrary to what people might think as you age, you're better off training harder for a shorter period of time. It's always within the realm of safe training. I mean, I think that's what I like to think that's what I bring to the table. Like an approach that's smarter so I can train harder. Like not doing the dumb things I did when I was a kid. And with that trade off being a harder trainer, I think I get the results that I want because I'm able to really push it and then back off and again, the meal feels like almost a physiological reward for the hard effort I put in the gym knowing that I'm also replenishing and setting the stage for the next day to be another successful day of training or maybe not depending upon how many times a day a week I train. I think that it's, It's a lot less, I hate to say but it's a lot less scientific than we want to make it. And as it seems to be coming back oftentimes like the thing that works for you is really the most important thing because ultimately getting your ass in there and doing what you do is really the thing that provides the best benefit. - Absolutely, and there are many things that I would say are hallmarks of Jeff Cavaliere, but one of them is certainly consistency. You make it happen one way or another. - Huge. I mean, consistency really is the determinant. And I know that that is the hardest part for people that are, and why people tend to look for the shortcut, 'cause consistency is the part that becomes the biggest challenge. But if you could find, listen, if you could find the, you know through what I've been trying to encourage here is like if you could find the nutrition approach, if you could find the training approach, if you could try find the training split, if you could try all those things that encourage you to want to go to the gym. Like you're locked in at the point where you said you actually look forward to going and doing your workout. - I love it. I look forward to, I mean, it's- Actually this morning, one of our teammates for the podcast and I got to workout and halfway through I just turned him and I said, I'll never figure out why that feels so good, but it feels so good. I just, I really enjoy it and it lets, and I love to eat and it lets me eat right and I love the way it makes me feel afterward. I don't understand this concept of not enjoying the gym. Cardio's a little different, I always loathe the first 10 or 20 minutes of a jog. I mildly loathe the middle third and by the end, I think this is the greatest thing ever, why don't want to do it all the time. And then that feeling evaporates before the next time I do it. - Yeah, of course I don't even remember it either, after we get on, then do it again. - [Andrew] Exactly. - I think if people could, if we had one gift we could give to everybody it would be the love of fitness. If they could be bestowed the love of fitness it would change the entire world. But I think when you hear things like this, that like, hey, that will work and that will work too and that this will work too. Rather than the dogmatic one way only approach, which could become discouraging for people. Then I think it becomes a little bit uplifting like, well, I've never tried that. I've actually never tried a total body split or I've never tried that style of eating. Like it becomes encouraging that you might want to explore and then you might finally get locked in and say, I really like this and then you're off and running. - Some of what I so enjoy about your content. We would be remiss if we didn't briefly discuss Jesse. One of the great pleasures for me in watching her content and learning from it over the years is that you took on a, you decided to mentor somebody, Jesse. And there's some poking fun back and forth between the two of you which is very amusing. But I have to say it inspired me to do something early on in developing this podcast as I have a young intern who has helped me with some of the research and he's a buddy, he's interested in science, he's about to go off to college, but he also got really into fitness. So we would watch the videos of you guys. He was helping me get the Instagram content out early on. And one thing that was just, it's such a pleasure to be able to pass along knowledge and of course I'm learning from him. This is always the way it works. We learn from teaching and we learn from students. But it's been great to see Jesse's progress, it's amazing. I've gotten to meet him in person just now and he has grown, he's changed physically. And I think that you mentioned a love of fitness. I think that one of the best ways to be consistent is to take on the responsibility of teaching others. Once one has proficiency in something. So maybe you just tell us a little bit about how that's going. How is Jesse doing and where does he need a little more work, where is he thriving? I'm impressed by the progress. - Well we have a, I mean, physically, we can obviously see the changes, the list of things to work on or is immense it's so long for him to continue to improve. But no actually, in reality, Jesse, the story of Jesse was that I knew Jesse prior to starting even Athlean-X. And a matter of fact, I think the funny thing is the very first video that was ever posted on my channel was a video that he shot as I don't know, a 13 year old or something. And I said, can you just film this for a second. I was over there training members of the family. So he then off went off to college, went into film, realized he had much greener pastures at Athlean-X instead of becoming the next [indistinct] or something and he decided to come work with me. And the expectations in the beginning were just to edit videos or just to help with various aspects of like my day to day that I don't think I was equipped to really handle and grow the business anymore. So then look at by virtue of being in that environment, there's an interest. I think if I worked in a gym, I might become interested in working out. And though that mine was not a commercial gym it's sitting right behind my office window, there became an interest in wanting to work out a little bit. And it wasn't even an intentional experiment to put Jesse there. I just thought that he's a very likable person. He has a very funny personality and he's also the, every man. In some ways as I'm sure maybe you experience sometimes like I'm the guy that this comes naturally for me is what people will say. Like, this is what you do for a living. Like this is what you- Like there's an element of disconnect in terms of the relatability because I do do this for a living. I can't deny that I do work with professional athletes. So like there's a level of interest in this above and beyond. But for him, he's just the kid who wants to train. Maybe if he rolls out of bed before 11:00 AM and doesn't have a date on Friday night, but that's the guy everybody could relate to. And watching him transform and I love the fact that even the interest level was up and down. Like it wasn't consistent for him because he was like, part interested and then maybe not interested for three months and then interested or not. And I never pushed it on him. This is again, this was no orchestrated experiment for me. It was just like, if you want to do this, then do this. And also from a standpoint of like lending my help or expertise to him, like I said, with my son, I'm not going to force it on anybody, I don't want to do that to anybody. I don't think that that's ever going to spark that desire for long term adoption. So he got more interested, he started to learn more about it, he watched just the videos that we're filming. He films the videos that we're filming and he's learning through what I'm saying he's becoming more of a student of the field. And I have to say his knowledge in the field has grown with the growth of his physique. And he's put into practice some of the things that I say, he's put in practice some things he hears other places and he winds up improving as he goes and he winds up starting to love this like he never thought he would. But it's great to see anybody grow and whether that be physically or that be emotionally or whether that be just in their career, it's great to see somebody grow. And I like to tease him. Funny admission here, there are times when the jabs that I will throw at him are something that we might know ahead of time of what I'm going to say to him. People will say you're so mean to him. I can't believe it you're that's so abusive. Like, dude, honestly, we laugh after it's over. It's good, we're good. So of course, but like... - He's tougher than he looks is what you're saying. - [Jeff] He's tougher than he looks, believe me. - And he looks tough, he's got the big beard. - He looks more manly than I do. I can't grow a beard, I don't, I mean, believe me, he's totally alpha and I'm like quickly becoming the second star of this show, but like he's definitely contributed and people enjoy his presence for sure. - Yeah, I certainly do. And I think that as you pointed out, he's a kind of a proxy and a template for everybody. We can relate to him because even though I've trained for many years, it's been a struggle through graduate school, post, made it happen one way or another, but with more or less attention and admittedly through waxing waning levels of motivation although I'm fortunate that I do enjoy it. - What I think is nice about it too is that it's a realistic expectation that we set. 'Cause you're showcasing what the journey actually looks like. And he's been on the journey for again devotedly for let's say the last year and a half but on the journey for five years. If I could make the gains that he did starting when I started training at 14, 15, and you're saying, hey, by 20, you're going to have the strength levels he does, the physique that he does, the knowledge that you've gained. Like that seems like a blink of an eye now looking back. At 46 years old, I'm like, holy cow. Like I think it took me 20 years, 15, 20 years to just even start to get into a groove. For him to do in a period of five years, it doesn't seem long whereas there's people that will criticize his journey like, oh, it's just taking so long and so like there's such an instant gratification that people seek, luckily that's the minority. Most people are like, this is amazing, but I think that it becomes very uplifting because not only is it relatable but the journey is real and people can appreciate that. Like, this is what will happen if you actually put in consistent hard work and you'll watch him transform and go back and watch the videos like you look at. We like to oftentimes throw back to videos where he appeared as smaller Jesse but also shy Jesse. Arms crossed, head down, not making eye contact with the camera to where now he's got his own skits and intros. It's like it's funny because the confidence with the growth of physique came confidence too, which is great. - Absolutely. Pretty soon it'll be his world and we'll all be living in it as they say. Well, on behalf of myself and all the listeners, I really want to thank you. First of all, for the discussion today, I learned an immense amount even though I thought I knew your content well, I still learned an immense amount, many things we could deploy from when to stretch, how to stretch, the skipping rope. We talked about nutrition, we talked about heat cold training regimens. And what I love about all of this now that you've given us is that there's a backbone of logic and some consistent themes indeed about consistency. But the logical backbone, I think is what will enable people to really show up to the table and stay there for training consistently over time. And as you said, the gift of fitness is an immense gift. I can't thank you enough. I know you're an incredibly busy human being with kids and dogs and a marriage and... - It's my pleasure. I'm happy I was able to make it work 'cause I really I've been watching your stuff for a while. And I really love the science of it, I like the way you think. And it's just, I'm just really fortunate that I was able to do it. - Oh well, I feel very gratified in hearing that and honored to have you here. So thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thank you for joining me for my discussion with Jeff Cavaliere. I hope you found it as interesting and as actionable as I did.

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing meditation. We are going to discuss the science of meditation, that is, what happens in the brain and body while we are meditating, and we will talk about the science of meditation as it relates to how the brain and body change as a consequence of meditation, that is, what you export or take from a meditation practice that can impact everything from your sleep to your mood. For instance, meditation has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression. And we will also talk about how meditation can be used to enhance focus and other states of mind that are useful for work and other aspects of life. Now, of course, most of you have probably heard of meditation, and when we think of meditation, most often, we think of somebody either sitting or lying down. If they're sitting, we might imagine them in the so-called lotus position, you know, sitting with legs crossed, very upright, with hands on the knees or, you know, crossed in our lap or something of that sort. Typically, we think of somebody who is in a very calm state, eyes closed, focused on their so-called third eye center. The third eye center is the area just behind one's forehead. There's no third eye there, at least there shouldn't be, but I'll tell you why it's called the third eye center and what the origins of that are and why it's relevant, actually, for a meditative practice. With all that said, it turns out that meditation encompasses a huge variety of different practices. Some of those practices indeed are done sitting or lying down with one's eyes closed, focusing on the third eye center. Other of those practices are focused on a body scan, you know, really focusing on one area of the body and its contact with whatever surface you happen to be sitting or lying on or can be done walking. In fact, there are walking meditations done with eyes open. So there are many different forms of meditation, but today, we are going to focus mainly on how specific types of meditation and specific areas of the brain that are activated during those meditations change our way of being in fundamental ways, not just during the meditation practice, but afterwards as well. So if you're somebody who's interested in changing your default state of mood or of thinking or enhancing your ability to focus or improving your sleep or improving performance in some cognitive or physical endeavor, meditation is powerful, but you want to make sure that you pick the right meditation practice. So we will talk about picking a meditation practice that isn't just feasible because you'll do it but is actually directed at the goals specific to you and what you need most. So to give you some sense of the contour of today's episode, first, I'm going to talk about some of the underlying biology, the mechanisms and the brain areas and also the areas of the body that are activated during certain forms of meditation, and, equally important, which areas of the brain and body are shut down or reduced in their activity during specific types of meditation. Then I'll transition into how to best do a meditation practice, how to get the most out of that meditation practice, and then I will talk about how to change or alter your meditation practices according to your specific goals and as you get better at meditation. And this can get a little bit counterintuitive, but in a positive way. What I mean by that is, for instance, a lot of people think that as you meditate and get better at meditating, you need to meditate more and more and more, sort of like if you get better at running endurance races that you need to keep running longer and longer, you know, first a 5K, then a 10K, then a marathon, then ultras. With meditation, it's actually quite the opposite. The better that you get at dropping into a particular brain state and the more your so-called traits of brain state shift, not just states as they're sometimes referred to, but traits, this is a theme that I've picked up from a terrific book that I'll refer to later, but the more that you can get into specific neural circuits quickly, actually, the less you need to meditate in order to derive the benefits of meditation. So that's a wonderful aspect of meditative practices that's unlike a lot of other forms of mental exercise and cognitive enhancing exercises. So we'll talk about all of that today, and I promise that by the end of today's episode, you will have a rich array of meditative practices to select from, you'll know why each of them work and why they can be directed toward particular goals and how to do that, and you'll also know how to modify those meditation practices under conditions where you might get busier or where you're suffering from lack of sleep, and I think a lot of people will be excited to know that today we're going to discuss a specific form of meditation that can indeed reduce your need for sleep and still allow you to enhance your cognitive and physical abilities. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals. Now, I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about hormones, blood lipids, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes understanding all of that very easy and, even better, points to specific directives, that is, things you can do in terms of your lifestyle, your nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, in order to bring those numbers related to metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera, into the ranges that are optimal for you, your immediate and long-term health. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics, and to be honest, I am not a fan of the word nootropics. I've said this many times before on this podcast and other podcasts, and the reason I don't like the word nootropics is that it means smart drugs. And as a neuroscientist, I'm aware that there are neural circuits, that is, connections in the brain and body that underlie things like focus or our ability to switch tasks or creativity, et cetera. There is no neural circuit for being smart. And so Thesis understands this, and as a consequence, they've developed custom nootropics that are designed to bring your brain and body into specific states to become, for instance, more focused or to engage in creative work or to have more energy for workouts and things of that sort. At Thesis, you can go there, you take a brief quiz, and they will design a kit of four different custom nootropics that you can try and then modify along with their help so that you can develop a kit of custom nootropics that are perfect for your needs. Perhaps one for creativity, another one for motivation, another one for focus, and another one for energy. They'll build those for you.

ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two all-American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. Now, I spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly. ROKA understands this and has designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses to be worn in any number of different conditions and for you to still be able to see with crystal clarity They were designed for things like cycling and running so they won't slip off your face if they get sweaty, they're extremely lightweight. In fact, most of the time, I can't even remember that they're on my face, they're so lightweight. However, they also can be worn anywhere, to work, to dinner, et cetera. They have a terrific aesthetic, unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there that you can only find in designs that really make people look like a cyborg. ROKA makes the cyborg versions, some people like those, but they also make versions of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with frames that you can wear out to dinner, to work, et cetera. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, go to roka.com, that's roka.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.

To find the supplements we discuss on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S, livemomentous.com/huberman. And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. Let's talk about meditation. As I mentioned earlier, we are going to talk about what areas of the brain and body are active during meditation and after meditation and why that can be so beneficial. We will also talk about when and how best to meditate. Now, this is a topic I've long been interested in. I was first given a book on meditation when I was in high school because, to make a long story short, I was a bit of a wild one early in my high school years, and as a consequence of a program that I was in, somebody handed me a book on meditation. That book is still available now. That book is called \"Wherever You Go, There you Are\" by Jon Kabat-Zinn. He was one of the first, not the only, but one of the first people to really start popularizing meditation and mindfulness practices in the United States. So this was in the late 1980s, and it was really only until recently that there were very few studies of meditation, although those really picked up in the '90s. Now you can find many, many thousands of studies on meditation and their mechanistic basis, so brain imaging studies, changes in hormones in the body. But in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s, because functional imaging of the brain, so-called MRI or fMRI, was really just starting to emerge as a popular tool in laboratories and hospitals, there really wasn't that much mechanistic understanding about how meditation worked, but, of course, there was a deep understanding from cultures outside the United States that meditation was extremely useful. I should just mention, as long as we're talking about the history of meditation, any discussion about meditation is going to be a discussion about states of mind, and any discussion about states of mind invokes the word consciousness, a kind of a dangerous topic to get into in any format because a lot of people talk about consciousness, but people use consciousness, the word, to mean different things. It doesn't have one standard operational definition as scientists call it. However, discussions about consciousness are often part and parcel with conversations about things like psychedelics and kind of alternative therapies. And so in the 1960s and especially in the 1970s, meditation and psychedelics were actually close cousins in the conversation about consciousness and states of mind. That conversation started to split into two different divisions, and I'll explain why in a moment. It gets to a little bit of interesting academic sociology. But what happened was there were a couple of guys at Harvard, including Timothy Leary and others, who got really interested in psychedelics, in particular LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide. And at that time, that was part of the whole counterculture movement, it was considered very anti-establishment, and they were really encouraging students at Harvard to take LSD. They were also very interested in meditation. But what ended up happening is they essentially got kicked out or fired from Harvard, and there's a book that I'll refer you to in the show note captions if you're interested in learning more about all this. But they got kicked out and fired for their emphasis on psychedelics. Now, nowadays, there's a lot of interest in psychedelics. We've had episodes with Dr. Matthew Johnson from Johns Hopkins University who's running clinical trials on psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD for the treatment of depression and PTSD. We've also had Dr. Nolan Williams on the podcast, my colleague at Stanford who's doing incredible studies on some of those compounds as well. So nowadays, the conversation about psychedelics is coming back, and it's somewhat divorced from the conversation about meditation, but in the 1960s and 1970s, the conversation about psychedelics and meditation was sort of one and the same. That changed in the late 1980s and early 1990s when people like Jon Kabat-Zinn started writing books that were purely about meditation and suggesting that people explore meditative practices for the utility to bring calmness, adjust stress, improve sleep, et cetera, divorced from the conversation about psychedelics. Now, that's not to say that the scientific community immediately embraced the conversation about meditation. In fact, it took quite a long while for schools like Harvard and Stanford and other universities around the world to start embracing and funding studies of meditation, asking what sorts of brain areas are involved, how it changes the body, and, perhaps most importantly, how a meditation practice can shift the brain and body when somebody is finished meditating and is off in their life doing their everyday things. In the late 1980s and especially within the 1990s, the advent of brain imaging technology like magnetic residence imaging, MRI, or functional magnetic residence imaging was a way to look at the brain while it was active, not just to get an image of its structure, but also how it's functioning in the areas that so-called light up. When all of that technology became accessible and popular, well, that allowed a large number of laboratories to start asking how specific patterns of thinking and breathing, maybe people sitting in the lotus position, but more often than that, it would be people inside of an MRI magnet because it is a magnet, they sort of put you into a little tube and push you into the tube, not against your will of course, but put people into the tube, have them meditate, and then look at how the brain changed and to do that over time. When those studies were done, what was discovered was really quite miraculous, really. And now we don't think of it as surprising, but what was discovered was a huge laundry list of brain changes. And then when people were evaluated in their outside life, so when they would fill out reports of their subjective feelings of happiness or they would report their sleep, or even if objective measures were taken like changes in hormones or markers of inflammation, et cetera, a large list of information fell out of that which revealed that indeed there are many, a dozen or more clear benefits of a regular meditation practice, and some of those meditation practices could be quite short. So nowadays, we think of meditation as pretty commonly accepted, and in fact, that has a lot to do with the fact that many of the major tech companies in the Bay Area during the 2000s such as Google and Apple and any number of different social media companies and other companies and business ventures, et cetera, and investment firms all over the world started hiring people to train meditation or had online courses for meditation. So nowadays, we think of meditation as this thing that almost everybody understands can benefit us, but we now sit at an interesting frontier where most people think of meditation as one thing, sort of like the word exercise, which, of course, could mean weight training, it could mean running, it could mean high-intensity interval training, all of which, as you know, will get you different results depending on what you do, how often you do it, and the specifics of what you actually do. So, too, meditation can give you very specific results. It can give you more focus, it can give you better sleep, it can give you a combination of results just like exercise can depending on the exercise. So what we are going to talk about next is the specific changes that happen in the brain with specific aspects of meditation. That is, what happens when you close your eyes, what happens when you focus your attention inward versus focusing your attention outward because, as I mentioned before, there's third eye meditation where you close your eyes and focus on that spot just behind your forehead and you focus on your breathing. There's also meditation practices where you're focusing on what you're eating with a lot of so-called mindfulness, being very present to whatever's happening, not letting your mind wander or think about yesterday or tomorrow or what's happening next, but really focusing on the present. There are also meditation practices, of course, where you are in a format of interpersonal communication where you're really listening very intensely. That, too, is a form of mindfulness. So we're going to parse each of these things, and we are going to ask what's happening in the brain and body during each of these meditation practices so that you can develop specific meditation practices that you can invoke in your real life on a daily basis or, thankfully, I would say, for some who are pretty busy, that you could even do once a week or even once a month that will still clearly benefit you in specific ways. I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so talking about the neuroscience of meditation, and I promise you I'm not going to just list off a bunch of different brain areas that are active during meditation. That wouldn't be useful to you. In fact, I don't believe in throwing out a lot of nomenclature without also giving some mechanistic explanation as to what different brain areas do. And you could say, \"Well, what good is it knowing what different brain areas do and their names if I can't actually manipulate those brain areas?\" But the good news is you actually can manipulate those brain areas. As I'll tell you today, you can turn up the activity in certain brain areas and turn down the activity in specific brain areas with specific elements of a meditation practice, so that's quite exciting and quite different really from other aspects of neuroscience that we might discuss on this podcast. So there are a few different brain areas whose names I'd like to arm you with. And again, the names themselves aren't essential, but if you can grasp even the top contour of what I'm about to say, you'll be in a much better position to parse and use the information that follows. There's an area of your brain that sits right behind your forehead that's called the prefrontal cortex. Basically, it's the front bumper of your head just behind the bone, okay? That area just behind your forehead that we call the prefrontal cortex actually encompasses a lot of different things. And actually, you have two of them. You have one on the right side of your brain and you have one on the left side of your brain, and they're connected to one another but they actually do different things. The area that I'd like to focus on today for a bit is the so-called left prefrontal cortex, or if we were going to get really specific, we'd say the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Dorsal means up, lateral means to the side, so if you want to touch the left side of your head and move your hand just toward the midline, toward the sort of top of your head a little bit, so that's dorsal, and then lateral, as long as your hand is still on the side of your head, you're in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, okay? So you've got your hand probably right over your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. That area of the brain, we know from lesion studies where it's been damaged in animals or humans and we know from stimulation studies where it's been selectively stimulated in animals, or yes, indeed, also it's been done in humans, has an incredible ability to control your bodily senses and to make sense, that is, to interpret what's going on in terms of your emotions and your bodily sensations. So from now on, unless I say otherwise, if I say prefrontal cortex, I'm specifically referring to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but I'm going to shorten that up just for sake of simplicity and ease of communication. If I'm going to talk about another area of prefrontal cortex, I'll talk about another area, but if I say prefrontal cortex today, what I mean is left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or, I should say more appropriately, when your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is active, you are in a great position to interpret what's going on with you emotionally, to interpret your bodily signals of comfort or discomfort, and then to make really good decisions on the basis of that interpretation. And that's because the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is in direct communication with and is directly connected to another brain area called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC. Now, I'm just going to refer to it as the ACC, okay? The ACC is an area of your brain that is interpreting a lot of different things about bodily signals, for instance, how fast you're breathing, whether or not your heart is beating quickly or slowly, and, more importantly, whether or not your heart is beating quickly or slowly for the circumstance that you are in. So for instance, if you're running up a hill and you're even in great shape and your heart is beating very fast, it's unlikely that you are going to be concerned about your heart beating fast because that is appropriate for the circumstance. However, if you're just walking along and all of a sudden, your heart starts beating very quickly for no apparent reason, well, then you are going to interpret that as either pathologic or uncomfortable, inappropriate for the context that you happen to be in. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is the area of the brain that actually has some control over and especially can interpret what's going on in this ACC region. Now, most of you probably haven't heard of the ACC. Most of you probably have heard of a brain area called the amygdala. It's an almond-shaped structure on the two sides of the brain, people talk about it as the fear center, et cetera. But your ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex, gets input from areas like the amygdala, your threat detection centers, but it also gets input from an enormous number of other areas of your brain and body, including your heart, your gut, so it gets information about how full, that is, distended, or how empty your gut is. It gets information about how quickly you're breathing from input from your lungs and related structures. It's an absolutely critical station for making sense of what's going on in your body, and it works very closely along with one other structure. And I promise this is going to be the third structure in this triad, and then I'll stop listing off names. So we have dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Think of that as sort of the interpreter of what's going on inside of you. You have the ACC, or anterior cingulate cortex, which is the area of your brain that's bringing in all this information about what's going on inside your body and even on the surface of your body. You know, if you have any pain or an itch or a mosquito bite on the surface of your body, your ACC would definitely register that. And then there's this other absolutely incredible brain structure which is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula, and the insula has a bunch of different parts to it. But the insula is another area that is interpreting signals of what's going on in your brain and body, so the ACC and the insula are working together to try and figure out, you know, what's going on inside me? And in addition to that, the insula is interpreting information about what's going on outside of you. So your insula is saying, for instance, hey, this is a steep hill that I'm running up, and as a consequence, whatever heart rate increase that I'm experiencing or heavy breathing or burning in my lungs, this all makes sense. I don't have to be worried, I don't have to be scared. I might want to slow down, but this makes sense. Whereas, for instance, in the example I previously gave, where if you're sitting in a room and everything is pretty calm, and all of a sudden, you start feeling really uncomfortable, like your stomach doesn't feel right or you start breathing quickly or you start having a so-called anxiety or panic attack, in large part, that's because the shift in your bodily sensations doesn't match or doesn't correspond to something in the outside world. So there's this incredible triad which includes the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulate or anterior cingulate cortex, and the insula, and those three are working together in a kind of conversation, it's a neural conversation, but a conversation nonetheless, trying to figure out, okay, what's going on inside me? How do I feel? What am I thinking about? And this could be thoughts about the past or the future or the present. They are also in a conversation as to whether or not the sensations that you're experiencing, meaning how quick your breathing is or how slow your breathing is, how your heart feels, how your skin feels, any sensations of pain, or pleasure for that matter, whether or not that makes sense for the situation you're in and trying to determine whether or not you are doing the right things as a consequence of those sensations. Okay, so again, if you can't remember the names of these different neural structures in the brain, don't worry about it. It's really not that critical. What is critical is that you understand that there's a conversation that's constantly occurring as long as you are awake trying to figure out what's going on inside of you and whether or not it makes sense relative to what's going on outside and around you. Now, humans are smart. That is, we are, to some extent, conscious of the fact that we have memories of the past, awareness of the present, and anticipation of the future. So we do realize, for instance, that we can be seated at the dinner table, excuse me, and have a thought about something tomorrow, maybe an exam that's stressing us out or something like that, and that will change our bodily state in a way that is not optimal for what we're doing in the moment but that can still make sense to us because that exam is important, maybe we're feeling some pressure about a hard conversation we have to have, or maybe we are very excited about the next day and we can't eat because we're so excited, and that can make perfect sense to us because we do have access to this knowledge about self that we can think about the past, the present, or the future. So that makes the conversation these three structures are in even more interesting and dynamic because what it means is that we can be doing something, eating, talking, running, any number of different activities, and our bodily state may or may not match what we are doing in a way that's adaptive for that, and yet that can be completely okay or at least understandable for us. Now, a major emphasis of a meditation practice is to make us so-called more mindful. What is mindfulness? Well, again, there isn't one perfect universally accepted operational definition of mindfulness. That's basically nerd speak for saying people can't agree exactly what mindfulness should be, is, and means for everyone. But most people assume, and I think agree, that mindfulness includes something about being present. And when I say present, that doesn't necessarily mean present to one's surroundings because of course a lot of meditation practices that are designed to make us more mindful and present are designed to make us more mindful and present to what's happening internally while ignoring everything that's happening externally, but they are designed to make us more present to our bodily sensations and, in particular, our breathing and our thoughts in the moment. So let's now explore what a generic meditation practice looks like, and let's evaluate how that tends to change the activity of these neural circuits in the brain and body. And then from there, we can split the conversation into a couple of different bins, that is, meditation practices that are ideal for enhancing focus, meditation practices that are ideal for improving mood, meditation practices that are ideal for improving sleep, and meditation practices that, believe it or not, benefit all of those things in one fell swoop. Okay, so what happens during a meditation practice at the neural level? In order to answer that question, we are going to be scientists. That means you and I are going to be scientists now. We are going to break down a practice into its different component parts and address what we know for sure about the brain activation states that occur with those different component parts. In order to do that, let's use a somewhat generic form of meditation, but it's generic and pretty far-reaching because I would say that for most people, about 75%, let's say, a meditation practice is going to involve stopping, meaning getting out of motion, sitting or lying down, and, in most cases, closing one's eyes, although it is absolutely not required to close one's eyes during meditation. There are many forms of meditation that are done eyes open. But for most people, it's going to involve stopping our movement, that is, not ambulating, not walking or running, so seated or lying down with eyes closed. When we do that, meaning when we sit or lie down and close our eyes, as trivial as that shift might sound to you, it actually is a profound shift in the way that your brain and other neural circuits in your body function for the following reason. When we close our eyes, we shut down a major avenue of what's called exteroception. What do I mean by exteroception? Well, very briefly, we are sensing things on our body and in our body all the time. We are also sensing things from outside of us all the time, so these could be sights or sounds, touch on our body, sensations withinside our body, et cetera. Now, sensation is distinct from what we call perception. Perception is, put simply, the sensations that we happen to be paying attention to. So at any given moment, you are sensing many, many things. There are sound waves hitting your ears, there are pressure receptors on the bottoms of your feet sensing your shoes or your sandals or the floor, et cetera, but you're not perceiving them until you place your attention on them. Now, the way perception works is that you have so-called spotlights of attention. You can't perceive everything all at once, every sound, every sight, every touch. That would be overwhelming. In fact, that would be terrible. Rather you have spotlights of perception that can either be very narrow, so for instance, you could focus all of your perception right now on your big toe of your right foot and really pour all of your awareness, your attention into what you're perceiving there, what it feels like, if there's tingling or pressure, heat or cold, et cetera, or you can broaden that spotlight to include both feet or all your toes on both feet and then your legs and your whole body or the entire room. Perception is like a spotlight, and I should mention there are very good data that we can split our attention into two but probably not more than two spotlights, and we can make those spotlights of perception either very broad and diffuse or very narrow. You can practice this now if you like. You can pick a spot on the wall away from you anywhere, or if you're driving, you can look at some location, and you can focus intensely on one small location, for instance, a tree in the horizon or a person on the street or any number of different things outside of you, or you can broaden that spotlight to include the entire scene at once. You can also focus a spotlight of perception on your body, say on the left upper portion of your chest. And of course you can focus on the left upper portion of your chest and something outside of you, you can split your attention between those two perceptual spotlights. It's very hard, although not impossible, to have three perceptual spotlights, but most people can split to two points of attention or perception pretty easily. The other thing that most people can do pretty easily is merge those two spotlights or, rather, to have just one spotlight of attention. So you don't always have to have two spotlights of attention on, and here, I'm using the word attention and perception interchangeably. But you could, for instance, have two points of attention, so you're talking to somebody and you're paying attention to whether or not somebody's walking in the door or not, so that's two, or you could be completely focused on the person you're talking to, or you could be completely focused on the stomach ache or the great sensation of hunger that you have in your belly while talking to somebody, in fact, you're not even listening to what they're saying at all. Okay? So you have two spotlights of perception. You can split them or merge them into one. And, this is very important, those spotlights of perception can intensify or dim, and there, I'm using analogy. What I mean by that is your perception of what's happening within those spotlights can be very, very high acuity. That is, you can register very fine changes in detail like tingling on one side of your big toe of your right foot versus the other, or it can be somewhat more diffuse. You're just thinking about your whole toe, which, in that case, seems like a small area, but the point is that you can consciously adjust the acuity, that is, the fineness of your perception. All of this is under your power because of the incredible ability of a brain structure whose name you now understand and know, which is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although there are other areas of your brain involved as well. Your ability to direct your attention to specific things in your environment or within your body or to split those points of attention or merge them or dial up the intensity of how closely you're paying attention to every little shift or ripple and change in sensation there or to kind of dissociate, if you will, for lack of a better word, to disengage from that perception, all of that is under control because of your ability to engage this area that we call the prefrontal cortex, and, in particular, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health, and those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera, and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3+K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D3+K2. Okay, so now if we look at the example of what happens when you sit or lie down and close your eyes and decide to meditate, you should immediately realize that that's a tremendous shift in your perceptual ability, why? Because that spotlight of attention, while it can be oriented toward, for instance, what you hear in the room or maybe the feeling of wind moving trees in the environment that you happen to be in, when we close our eyes, we shut down one of the major avenues for sensory input, which is vision. And when we do that, there's a tendency for those perceptual spotlights to be focused more so on what happens at the level of the surface of our skin and inside of our bodies. And that informs us about something very important, which is that there are actually two axes or two ends of a continuum of perception. Up until now, I've been talking about perception and intention as kind of the same thing, and indeed they are, at least for sake of this conversation, but within that word perception or within that word attention, there's a continuum, and that continuum has on one end something called interoception. Interoception, spelled with an I, is everything that we sense at the level of our skin and inward, so the sensation inside our stomach, the sensation of our heart beating. Some people can sense their heart beating pretty easily. Other people have more challenge doing that. What we are feeling on the surface of our skin, how hot or cold we feel, that's interoception. In contrast, at the other end of the continuum is so-called exteroception, spelled with an E. Exteroception is perception of everything that's outside or beyond the confines of our skin. So by shutting our eyes, and in particular, in a meditative practice where we direct our attention toward our so-called third eye center, this area right behind our forehead, which, not so incidentally, is the prefrontal cortex, or in some cases where people will focus on their breathing, so the movement of their stomach or the movement of their diaphragm or the lifting of their chest or the extension of their belly while they breathe. By doing that, we are taking what ordinarily is a perceptual state that's split between the outside world, exteroception, and usually also toward our inner state. You know, most people are generally in touch with how they are feeling from the skin inward while they are also paying attention to what's outside of them. You can think about somebody, for instance, at a restaurant or a sandwich shop about to order a sandwich and you're reading the menu, so that's exteroception, right? The menu is outside the confines of your skin. And little ideas or maybe big ideas come to mind about what the roast beef sandwich or the vegetarian sandwich will taste like, what it will do for you, what's in it, what you like, what you don't like, et cetera. That's splitting interoception and exteroception. But when we close our eyes, we stop, we slow down, we focus on our breathing or that third eye center, the majority of our perception then shifts to interoception. And when we shift down to that end of the continuum of interoception, something very important happens. What happens is that those two regions, the ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the insula, really ramp up their levels of neural activity, and that should make perfect sense to you because those are areas of your brain that are registering and paying attention to the various sensations of how full or empty your stomach feels, whether or not the surface of your skin feels hot or cold, and on and on. So by just sitting down or lying down and closing your eyes, your brain undergoes a massive shift from exteroception to interoception. Now, that's not to say you can't be distracted by external events, and, in fact, many people are, but the early stages of transitioning into a meditative state involve this shift down the continuum, or, I should say, to one end of the continuum because there's no down-up, there's just the continuum, shift along the continuum to heightened levels of interoception. Now, I mentioned this briefly before, but many people are very interoceptively aware just naturally, even if they don't do a meditation practice. Other people are not. And there's a pretty good measure of whether or not you have high levels of interoceptive awareness or capability, and that is your ability to count your heartbeats without placing your fingers anywhere with any pressure to take your pulse. You can do this if you like, you can actually try and estimate your number of heartbeats simply by trying to feel your heart beat. Some people are very good, meaning they're very accurate at doing this, other people are not. It does seem to be an ability that can be trained up quite a bit, and, in fact, meditative practices will improve your interoceptive awareness, but, and this is a very important point, heightened levels of interoceptive awareness, while that might sound attractive, oh, to be really in touch with your body, that is not always beneficial, why? Because many people who, for instance, have excessive levels of anxiety have excessive levels of anxiety because they are very keenly aware of any subtle shift in their heart rate or breathing or change in the sensations within their stomach. Whereas other people who are less aware of their bodily state, that can be beneficial, right? It can be adaptive or not, depending on the circumstances. It's probably not adaptive to be very, very aware of your internal state if, for instance, you're doing public speaking, you don't want to be thinking about what's going on in your stomach or how quickly you're breathing. I'm certainly trying to ignore all those signals, those sensations now. But for somebody who has no awareness of what's going on, very little interoceptive awareness, that can be problematic, too, because these are the very people who can ignore the fact that they're having a heart attack or can ignore the fact that they have high blood pressure and are carrying about life focused on everything external with no awareness of their own body. They're, quote, unquote, out of touch with their body. So we want to be very careful about placing valence, which is a sort of value of good or bad on interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. More importantly, we want to emphasize that when you undergo a meditation practice, if it's of the sort where you stop your movement and close your eyes, you are training for interoceptive awareness. This becomes important later when we get into discussions about meditation for reducing anxiety. Some people may opt, in fact, I would say some people ought to opt for a meditative practice which involves more exteroceptive awareness, actually a meditation like a walking meditation or even a seated meditation where they are bringing their focus to a place outside their body as opposed to inside their body. And in fact, there are examples of people who have meditated quite a lot who develop such a heightened state or awareness of their interoceptive components, that is, just fancy, again, nerd speak for so aware of their breathing and of their heart and of the state of their gut that it actually is intrusive for daily activities. So I will ask you to ask this question of yourself now. Are you somebody who tends to be very in touch with your bodily sensations, so, for instance, from the skin inwards? Or are you somebody who tends to be less in touch with or aware of your interoceptive state? There is no right or wrong answer. You don't get an A or an F or a D or a C depending on your answer. It's just a good question for each and every one of us to answer, and I think most people will answer that it depends. It depends on whether or not you are in a social setting or whether or not you're alone. But we are going to return to that answer so keep it in mind because it will become very beneficial in building an optimal meditation practice for you. But for now, just note, there's this continuum of perception, interoception and exteroception. Closing your eyes increases interoception. Opening your eyes dramatically increases exteroception just automatically, just automatically because so much of your brain, in fact, 40% or more, is dedicated to vision. And this, I should say, for those of you that are low vision or no vision and those of you that are blind or have poor vision, this entire process is translated to the auditory, to the sound domain, so it's true for people that can see and it's true for people that can't see. Of course, people that can't see, closing the eyes doesn't have this huge shift towards interoception, but there have been a few studies, not as many as I would've liked to find, but a few studies of, for instance, people who are blind or have low vision, don't see very well, and when they close their ears and they can't hear the external world or they put headphones on or noise-canceling headphones, then the world inside of them becomes very prominent relative to the world outside of them for obvious reasons. So I asked you to ask yourself whether or not you are somebody who tends to be more interoceptively aware or not, more exteroceptively aware or not. And some of you might not be able to answer that question, and if you can't, chances are that you are effectively sliding along that continuum depending on the activities that you're doing. So you're probably the kind of person where if somebody comes over to you and starts talking to you, you will engage in that conversation, and you don't feel so inside your body that you're thinking about your heart beating and whether or not you're flushing red, et cetera, you're going to pay attention to what they say. Many people, however, when somebody talks to them, if they have social anxiety or even a slight bit of social anxiety, will be thinking about whether or not their cheeks are flushing or whether or not they look right or sound right or whether or not they have something in their teeth. These are normal responses, but they really speak to this issue of whether or not you tend to shift more towards interoceptive awareness or exteroceptive awareness. And, of course, it's context dependent. It will depend on whether or not you're, you know, out on a date with somebody that, you know, you would loathe to find out later that you had food in your teeth or whether or not you're with somebody you're more familiar with where that would not really matter much or the other person would tell you this kind of thing. What does it mean to be at one location or another location along this continuum of interoception or exteroception? Well, we know what it means neurally, right? We know that if you are more interoceptively aware, your insula and ACC are active, but that's not very useful. That's not helpful as a tool. That's just a fact. Now, there have actually been studies of what a meditation practice can do in terms of moving you along this continuum from where you naturally sit in order to help you function not just during the meditation but at all times. And in order to illustrate this, I want to start with a description of what is now a classic study. It's a very cool study, it has a very cool name. It talks about something very important that will come up again and again in today's conversation, and that's something called the default mode network. The default mode network is a collection of different brain areas that essentially are active when we're not doing much of anything and certainly is active when we are not focused on one particular task or conversation or activity. The default mode network can be thought of more or less as the network that generates mind wandering or our thoughts drifting from the past to the present to the future. Remember, earlier, I talked about how your perceptual spotlight can either be two spotlights or they can merge. Well, similarly, human beings can think about the past, surely, the present, definitely, and the future. And it turns out we can also split our thoughts just like we can split our perception into two of those three things, so I can think about the past, a past event, and I can think about the present. I can split my thinking and my memory in that way. I can also think about the present and the future. I can also think about the future and the past, although it's very difficult, although not impossible, to split one's thinking and memory into the past, the present, and future simultaneously, not easily done, but pretty easy to split one's attention and thinking into two of those three things, either the past, the present, and the future or any two of those three things, okay? Just like with attentional spotlighting, you can place your mind, your thinking, and your memory, your cognition onto one of those things and be very, very present or the past and the present and so on and so forth. The default mode network, while it involves a lot of different brain areas, can be thought of simply as the network of brain areas that are active when your mind is wandering between these different time domains. And the paper I'd like to share with you, as I mentioned before, is now a classic paper, it has a wonderful title, which is A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind. Now, that sounds almost like a news article or a news article about a scientific paper, but that's actually the title of the scientific paper which was published in the journal, \"Science,\" which is one of the three apex journals. You know, scientific publishing is competitive, but it's especially competitive to get manuscripts accepted into \"Science,\" into \"Nature,\" and into the journal \"Cell,\" so it represents kind of the Super Bowl, NBA Championships, and Stanley Cup, if you will, for you sports aficionados of scientific publishing. This is a paper from Matthew Killingsworth and Dan Gilbert. It was published in 2010, but it's still considered a classic. And this paper, A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind, has a number of very important points. I'm going to paraphrase certain elements of it for you because they say essentially what I would like you to know far better than I could say. So first of all, they started out with a statement, which I confess I disagree with, which is, \"Unlike other animals, human beings spend a lot of time thinking about what is not going on around them: contemplating events that happened in the past, might happen in the future, or will never happen at all.\" I agree with their assertion that human beings do that. That's certainly my experience, although I must say, I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever that other animals don't do it also. So my apologies, Killingsworth and Gilbert, but I'd be happy to go toe-to-toe with you on that. I am not aware of any data that prove one way or the other what other animals are thinking. So let's set aside other animals, and let's focus on the human animal. Now, their point is still a very good one, which is that humans have this wandering of the mind that they call stimulus-independent thought. That is, there's nothing happening to create these thoughts or anything happening in the immediate environment. These thoughts are just happening on their own internally. That's the default mode network. This study was important. In fact, it was a landmark study because they did it right about the time that smartphones became widely available and in use, so again, 2010. So they basically pinged people, they contacted people on their iPhones many times per day, and they did this for well over 2,200 adults. They had a mix of male and female people in this study. The mean age was 34 years, but there was a range, mean, of course, being average, but there were a range of different ages and so forth. And at any moment, they asked people, \"What are you feeling right now?\" And they also asked them, \"What are you doing right now?\" So they were looking for the match or mismatch between what people were doing and what they were feeling. They were essentially trying to probe what people were thinking about, and they also addressed that. And they came up with a kind of a bubble chart, if you will, where the bigger the bubble, the more answers came back about one particular thing, and they assessed whether or not people were happy or not in that moment, or sad or not, whether or not they were focused on what they were doing or not. There are a lot of bubbles in this chart, so I'm not going to read them all. But the important points that came from the data, and, again, this is a very large data set, was that, and here again, I'm paraphrasing, first, people's minds wandered frequently regardless of what they were doing. In nearly half of the samples taken, people were generally thinking about something else, except, it turns out, there's this one little bubble sitting way far out on the horizon here, people claimed, and I'm inclined to believe them, that they tend to be very focused on making love if they were making love in the moment where they were pinged on their iPhone. Now, why their iPhone was there with them at that moment, I don't know. That wasn't included in this description of the study. But all the other activities, grooming and self-care, listening to the news, watching television, relaxing, working, et cetera, et cetera, during all those activities, people claimed that their mind wandered a lot. And then they also assessed, of course, their mood and how those people felt at any given moment depending on what they were doing and how well their mind and their emotions matched what they were doing. And what they say here is second, they revealed that people were less happy when their minds were wandering than when they were not, and this was true during all activities. And then third, what people were thinking at a given moment was far better a predictor of their happiness than what they were doing. So this is interesting and I think matches a lot of people's experience. In fact, I think as you hear about this study, many of you will probably just say, \"Well, duh.\" I mean, if you're working and you don't like your work and you're thinking about something bad that happened, well, then of course you're not going to be happy. But the key point of this study is that it did not necessarily have to be the case that people were thinking about something unpleasant. In fact, if people were working and they were thinking about something else that was pleasant, that also made them feel unhappy. In other words, the mismatch between being in an activity and having our mind elsewhere led people to report themselves as feeling more unhappy in that moment. And when you total this up, what you find is that people are often not present to what they are doing, and that is a great source of unhappiness, even if their thoughts are those of happy, joyful thoughts. So this is interesting and I think runs counter to what most of us have heard or have been taught, which is, you know, think good thoughts, you know, try and suppress bad thoughts, have a good internal landscape, you know, create a good narrative. That is all true, but equally if not more important is to have the ability to be fully engaged in what you are doing at a given moment. That is the strongest predictor of being happy. And there were several other studies that followed up on this, but their conclusion that they put in the final short paragraph of this paper I think really captures it beautifully. They say, and here, I'm quoting directly, \"In conclusion, a human mind is a wandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind. The ability to think about what is not happening in a moment,\" I added the in a moment part, \"is a cognitive achievement that comes at an emotional cost.\" So I know I'm not alone in believing that this paper, A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind, and we will provide a link to this paper in the show note captions, is absolutely key in understanding why a meditation practice is so important because a meditation practice is really about adjusting your place along that interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum to what you happen to be experiencing in that moment. And while most people think of a meditative practice as focusing on what's going on internally with your eyes closed, third eye center, focusing on your breathing, et cetera, for any number of minutes or maybe even an hour or longer, there are other forms of meditation in which your exteroception dominates and which you are actively focusing on things outside or beyond the confines of your skin and internal landscape, and that, too, is meditation. And if we are to take the work of Killingsworth and Gilbert, this A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind, seriously, and I know a number of other laboratories have and have supported this research with their findings again and again and again, what this means is that meditating is not necessarily a practice that we do divorced from the rest of life. Meditation and mindfulness in particular, being present to what we are doing in a given moment is one of the essential keys to happiness and improved mood even if what we are doing is unpleasant. So that brings us to a tool, and it's a tool that any and all of us can use whether or not you tend to be interoceptively dominant, right, that you tend to pay more attention to your bodily sensations, or exteroceptively dominant. And, again, if you don't know the answer to that question, there's a simple test that you can do. You can just sit down or lie down, close your eyes, and you can ask yourself or assess whether or not your attention tends to fleet to things outside of you, right, cars honking or going by, people in the room, or whether or not you tend to be able to focus on your internal landscape to the exclusion of exteroception and attention to things outside the confines of your skin easily. Now, of course, this will depend on context and situation, even how well rested you are, et cetera, but that's exactly the point. This is the sort of thing you want to do every time you decide to do a meditation practice. In fact, I would suggest that you use this to determine what meditation you do at any given moment. So let's say you are somebody who is a regular meditator or let's say you're somebody who's never meditated and you'd like to develop a meditation practice. I suggest that you do a test of whether or not you are more interoceptively dominant or exteroceptively dominant in that moment. Again, this is not a personality trait. This is a question about where you happen to be in a moment. So let's say you're on a plane or you're in the car. If you're in the car, please don't close your eyes while driving, that's sort of obvious, but do this in a safe way, please. But stop, close your eyes, and assess whether or not you can access and focus your attention primarily on your internal state or whether or not your attention and perception gets pulled to something external, to exteroception. And, again, that will vary depending on circumstance and who you are. Then I suggest opening your eyes and trying to focus your attention to something external to you and seeing or evaluating the extent to which you can divorce your perception from sensations that occur at the level of your skin or internally. Now, I should say that there's no technology, at least not that I'm aware of, absence of fMRI machine, in which case, you are inside an fMRI machine while you do this. But unless you are in that experiment, and most of us aren't, there's no technology that can tell you, for instance, whether or not you are interoceptively dominant or exteroceptively dominant and whether or not the ratio is, you know, 75 to 25 or what have you at any given moment. You have to assess this subjectively. However, if you sit down, for instance, and you notice that you can equally split your attention between internal sensations and external sensations or whether or not you find yourself pulled into external sensations when you're trying to focus inward or you find yourself pulled inward when you're trying to focus outward, well, that will dictate the sort of meditation that you perhaps ought to perform in that moment. Let me give an example of how you would do this. You would stop in some way, so sit or lie down, close your eyes, and evaluate whether or not you can essentially rule out or eliminate attention to all outside events. Most people won't be able to do that entirely, but try and focus your attention, for instance, on your breathing or the typical third eye center, you know, focusing at a spot right behind your forehead. If you feel you can do that reasonably well to the exclusion of what's happening around you, well, then an important question arises. Should you meditate in a way to enhance that interoceptive awareness? Or rather, should you meditate in a way, for instance, with your eyes open and your attention on a particular portion of the landscape you're in like a tree or maybe even, you know, an object or a plant or something else in your immediate environment to try and cultivate or enhance your exteroceptive awareness? That's up to you, but my bias would be one in which you work against your default state. Again, the default mode network is where you land on this interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. It's going to lead to more mind wandering, whereas when you encourage or we could even say force yourself a little bit to anchor your attention to either inside your body or outside your body, and you make that decision according to what you are doing less easily, well, then you are actively training up the neural circuits. You are engaging so-called neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience. You are deliberately engaging a shift along that continuum. To make this crystal clear, what I mean is this. Let me give an example. If I were to sit down and I wanted to do some meditation, let's just say three minutes of meditation. There's good evidence that even three minutes of meditation can be beneficial for a variety of things, including enhanced focus and enhanced anxiety management. Let's say I sit down and I notice that I can really focus inward on what's happening at the level of my skin and my internal organs, and I can rule out everything. Maybe that's 'cause the room is quiet or maybe it's just because my brain is in a state that I'm particularly good at that at that moment or maybe it's just a natural ability. Well then I would opt for a three-minute meditation practice in which I deliberately exterocept, that I build up the circuitry to focus on something external to me because I want, and I think most people would like, to have an adaptive mechanism within them so that they can slide along that continuum and they don't default to whatever happens to be easiest for them in that moment. Now, if I were to sit down and try and focus on what's going on internally and I kept getting distracted by things happening outside of me, opening my eyes or feeling like I need to reach for my phone or paying attention to the sounds in the room, well, then I would actively engage a meditation practice, in this case, a three-minute example but it could be longer, where I'm deliberately trying to focus my perception on events at the level of the confines of my skin and internally. Why do I say this? Well, you know, I love to use the phrase anytime with kids, you know, when they say \"This is really hard or something's challenging,\" or adults will say, \"That's really tough.\" Well, as my graduate advisor used to say, that means you're learning. If something were easy, if you can perform any activity or thought, et cetera, well, then there is absolutely zero reason for your neural circuits to change. It's the friction, it's the feeling that something is hard that turns on the enormous variety of mechanisms at the level of cells, et cetera, that allow you to potentially change your neural circuitry. So challenge and discomfort is the signal to your brain and body that something needs to change, so I'm encouraging you to embark on meditative practices that are not your default, okay? To essentially go against the grain of where your interoceptive bias or your exteroceptive bias happens to be at a given moment. And, again, this will change. For some of you, this will change across the day where early in the day, you are very, very good at doing an interoceptive-biased meditation, and later in the day, you aren't. I actually believe, based on the data that I've covered, and we'll get into a few more papers about this, and my lab is actively working on this as well, that a meditative practice can be made far more effective, that is, it can invoke more neuroplasticity, more shift in brain states and brain circuitry if we do not take the easy path, that is, we go against the grain of what our brain would naturally do in a given moment. So if you're in a crowded airport and you're finding that everything's very distracting, well, then that would be a great time to do some interoceptive focused meditation. Whereas if you are really in your head, you know, you're looping thoughts about the past and present, maybe you're even in obsessive thought, well, that would be a terrific time, an ideal time really, to do a short meditation focused on something external to you. In both cases, whether or not you're focused on interoceptive bias or exteroceptive bias, you are going against, or I should say you're pushing back against your default mode network. I would argue it's going to be far more effective, that is, you're going to reduce or shift the activity of that default mode network far more and in a far more beneficial way if you actively try and suppress your bias toward being more interoceptive or exteroceptive. Now, I think that's immensely beneficial, both for the immediate changes that you experience, what others have called a state change, because that's what it is, and it also can lead to, as we referred to earlier, more neuroplasticity, more changes in the brain circuits that underlie your default mode network and lead to what are called trait changes. And I want to be very clear that I am not the first to make this state versus trait distinction. That's a distinction that was raised in a really wonderful book. In fact, I can't recommend this book highly enough. The book is \"Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body.\" This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson who've done terrific work and many writings and many TED Talks, et cetera, about meditation. I would say that circa 2016, 2017, this book really captured what I believe to be the most essential elements of the science of meditation and a lot of the history of it as well. Today, we are focusing on much of what's covered in this book but also a lot of things that have happened, excuse me, since 2017. In fact, most of the papers that I'm going to talk about are papers that were published after 2017. But, again, this is a wonderful book where they very clearly distinguish between state changes and trait changes, trait changes being the more long-lasting ones. My read of this book and the literature that follows is, again, that when you sit down to meditate, it is going to be most effective to do that interoceptive, exteroceptive bias assessment. Ask yourself whether or not you are more in your head or outside your head, if you will, and then to do a meditation practice that runs counter to where you happen to be at, that is, that pushes you more externally if you're in your head, and if you're more focused on what's going on around you, that pushes you more internally. Now, I think most people are familiar with how to do an interoceptive-biased meditation. Again, that would be setting a timer. Maybe you don't have even set a timer, you just sit or lie down, close your eyes, focus on that third eye center behind your forehead or focus on your breathing or your bodily sensations. That's typical and often discussed. Exteroceptive based meditations, you pick a focal point outside or beyond the confines of your skin, so that could be, for instance, a point on the wall if you are indoors, it could be a plant, it could be a point on the horizon far away. What you will find is that your visual system will fatigue a little bit when you concentrate your visual focus at that location. I want to remind you that it is perfectly okay and, in fact, necessary to blink, so you should blink, you can relax your face, you can change your expression. There is no rule that says that you can't do those things. This is not, you know, just beaming a particular location in space and holding your eyelids open. I've been accused many times of not blinking very often. That's for other reasons. It's part of the way I access memory about what I want to say. I don't use a prompter here, so I'm accessing from a sort of internal image in my head. That's how my memory works. But in any case, if you're going to do an exteroceptive-biased meditation, there is absolutely no reason why you wouldn't look away from that location every once in a while in the same way that if you were focused on internal thoughts with your eyes closed and focused on your breathing, every once in a while, your thoughts will skip away from that breathing or from your third eye center. In fact, and this is discussed in the book \"Altered Traits\" but by many other people as well, one of the key elements of any meditative practice, whether or not it's interoceptively focused or exteroceptively focused, is that it's really a refocusing practice. The more number of times that you have to yank yourself back into attending or perceiving one specific thing. In other words, the more times your mind wanders and you bring it back, actually the more effective that practice is. Again, if you can just focus on one location with laser precision and your mind never darts away from that and you don't have to bring it back, well, then there's no neuroplasticity, nothing needs to change because your nervous system will effectively know it's performing perfectly. So if you're somebody who tries to do meditation and you find that your mind just wanders, just remember every time you scruff yourself and pull yourself back to focusing on some location externally or focus back on your breath or your third eye center, each one of those aren't just opportunities to do better, they are essential to the improvement process. Think about them as ascending a staircase of refocusing. Every time you refocus, you're going up one more level, another stair, another stair, another stair, and I think that will move you away from the kind of judgmental process of thinking, \"Ugh, like, I can't focus on anything.\" Pretty soon, what you'll notice is that the refocusing process will happen so quickly that you don't even perceive it. And, again, this is something that's borne out in the neuroimaging data. A lot of people think that they can focus with laser precision, but actually, what they are better at doing is refocusing more quickly and consistently over time. There's a classic study about this in very experienced meditators that was done in Japan where they had people with varying levels of meditation ability, so some who had never meditated, others who were really expert meditators with many hundreds if not thousands of hours of meditation under their belt, and they had those people listen to 20 tones repeated over and over, the same tone, and they found that the expert meditators could really focus, and they did this by brain imaging, they could really focus on all 20 tones, whereas most people kind of attenuate or what's called habituate to the tone so that by the 10th or 11th tone, their mind is really going to something else. Now, that's wonderful, but that really just tells us the expert meditators have better focus. But it turns out that the more modern neuroimaging studies have shown that they don't have better focus such that they're staying in a very narrow trench of focus. What they're doing is they're exiting focus and going back in more quickly, more quickly, more quickly over and over again. So rather than think about your ability to focus, think about your ability to refocus, and the more number of times you have to refocus, the better training you're getting. So earlier, I mentioned doing this interoceptive-biased or exteroceptive-biased meditation for three minutes. Why did I say three minutes? Well, three minutes seems like a reasonable number for most people to do consistently, you know, once a day. And in fact, there are some studies of one-minute meditations and three-minute meditations and 10 and 60. My laboratory has been studying a 5-minute-a-day meditation, and that clearly has benefits, but I think it's also clear that by three minutes, many of the benefits are starting to arrive. And so while I'm not pointing at any one particular data point here, it's very clear that forcing oneself to direct one's perception, that is, your attention, to your internal state or to something external to you is immensely beneficial if you do it consistently and is, again, especially beneficial if you're focusing your attention on the portion of your experience, either internal or external to you, that is not the one that you would default to in that moment. And some people have taken this to the extreme to say that, you know, you can even just move about your day, and then every once in a while, just do a one breath meditation. To be honest, when I look at the whole of the data, it seems as if it doesn't really matter in order to derive most of the benefits of a meditation practice. Now, I'm a big fan of some of the newer meditation apps that are out there. One in particular that I've been using and that actually I started using because my dad is a big fan of it and he does now fairly long meditations. He's doing about 10 or 20 minutes at least every other day and often every day, and he convinced me to check out the Waking Up app that Sam Harris has put out. I looked at it, I think some of it sits behind a paywall, but you can access much of it or at least do a trial and try it out without having to get behind that paywall. They're not a sponsor of this podcast, I should mention, but I decided to use the Waking Up app. I think it's terrific, and I think one of the reasons it's terrific is that Sam includes short descriptions of what meditation is doing and what a specific meditation can do for you just prior to doing that meditation. So those meditations can be quite brief. Some of them are a minute long, two minutes long, some are longer or even quite a bit longer. That app, I think, includes a variety of meditations that really encompasses the huge range of possibilities that are possible with meditation, and that, at least by my experience of the Waking Up app, has led to my most consistent meditation practice. And, of course, I would love to get Sam on the podcast as a guest so we could talk about the sort of underpinnings of the Waking Up app and his views on everything from meditation to, I know he's big in the discussion about free will and consciousness, some of the very deep and somewhat abstract discussions. I really hope to get Sam on the podcast at a time not too far from now. Meanwhile, we've never met in person, but I absolutely love the Waking Up app, Sam, and I know my father does as well, and I know many of you already use it. If you haven't tried it already, I really do encourage you to check it out. I want to talk just briefly about this third eye center business because it turns out to be pretty interesting. The third eye is actually a name that's been given to another neural structure, or I should say structure because it's not strictly neural, and that's the pineal gland, and this has an interesting history. I promise I'm not taking off on a tangent here that isn't relevant to meditation. So you have a brain of course, and on both sides of your brain, you tend to have mirror symmetric representations of the same things. What do I mean by that? Well, you have a prefrontal cortex on the right, you have a prefrontal cortex on the left, and they actually do slightly different things. Language is sometimes lateralized to one side, but in general, for every structure that you have on one side of the brain, you have the same structure on the opposite side of the brain. There's one clear exception to that, and that's the pineal gland. The pineal gland is the gland that makes melatonin, which, at night when it gets dark, secretes melatonin, and that melatonin makes you sleepy, it helps you fall asleep but not stay asleep. Descartes, right, the philosopher Descartes asserted that the pineal was the seat of the soul because it was the one structure in the brain that he saw was not on both sides of the brain, it was only one of them and in the middle. Now, I don't know if it's the seat of the soul or not, I'm not in a position to make assessments like that. But what do we know about the pineal? The pineal, as I mentioned, is involved in releasing melatonin, it does a few other things as well, but it is also considered the third eye for a couple of reasons. One is that it responds to light, although, in humans, not directly. So in birds and lizards and snakes, they actually either have a thin skull, or, believe it or not, two holes in the top of their skull that allow light to go directly in. If you look at the head of a snake, light can go directly into their brain through these holes and activate the pineal to suppress melatonin and control their wakefulness, sleep rhythms. In birds, they don't have holes in their skull, but they have very thin skulls. And, believe it or not, light can penetrate the thinness of the skull in many birds and communicates information about time of day and even time of year, and that's translating to hormonal signals such as melatonin release from the pineal. And so the pineal has been called the third eye because it's a light-sensitive organ inside the brain. In humans, the pineal sits deep, deep, deep to the surface, and light cannot get in there. In fact, if light can get into your brain, unless you are part of a specific experiment where that's the intention or you're having neurosurgery or something of that sort, then you've got serious issues happening. That pineal sits deep, deep, deep near what's called the fourth ventricle, and it absolutely should not see light directly. So the idea that the pineal is the third eye in humans is not true. It just isn't true. So anytime someone says, \"Oh, the pineal is your third eye.\" That's not the third eye center that people are referring to when they talk about meditation. Now, you'll see a number of different forms of art where it will be a picture of a face and the eyes will be closed or sometimes open, and there'll be literally a third eye, like a cyclops eye in the middle of the forehead. That has been proposed for many thousands of years to be, quote, unquote, the seat of our consciousness. Now, that's interesting because that real estate behind the forehead actually turns out to be the prefrontal cortex, which we know from lesion studies and stimulation studies, if you remove that brain area, people become very reflexive. They are not thinking intentionally, they don't become deliberate. In fact, and this is kind of an eerie result, but if you inactivate, you turn off the prefrontal cortex and you give somebody the opportunity to play a shooting game, for instance, their accuracy goes through the roof. They become essentially like a machine. They see a stimulus, they shoot at it, they see a stimulus, they shoot at it. Their accuracy is exceptional, but their ability to distinguish between enemy and friend completely disappears. So they become a highly effective motor, or I should say sensory motor machine, but their assessment and their judgment about right or wrong completely disappears. This is also true for people that have prefrontal damage. They often will have inappropriate behavior or a hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera. So the third eye center as the seat of consciousness and our intention is something that makes sense generally with what we know about the neuroscience and neurology, but there's something more to it that I think is especially important for all of you that goes beyond anything about ancient traditions or pineals or birds or snakes and pits in the top of the head, and here's what it is. The brain itself, meaning the brain tissue, does not have any sensory neurons. What do I mean by that? Well, if I touch the top of my hand, I can feel that. If I want to sense my heartbeat, if I work at it, I can feel that. If I want to sense how I feel internally at the level of my stomach, is it full, is it empty, am I hungry, is it acidic, does it ache or does it feel pleasant, et cetera, I can sense that. And that's because we have sensory neurons on our skin and in our body, et cetera. We also have sensory neurons in our eyes that let us perceive things externally. We have no sensory neurons on our brain. This is one of the reasons why you can remove the skull and do brain surgery on somebody who's wide awake and be poking around in there, and they don't need any anesthetic on the brain itself. They need anesthetic for the incision site, but they don't need anesthetic on the brain because it has no feeling. You have emotions, but there's no feeling. So normally, we are perceiving and paying attention to what we are sensing, either externally, sight and sounds, again, exteroception, or internally, interoception, touch, et cetera. But by focusing our perception and our attention not on our bodily surface like a body scan, but to a point a couple centimeters or inches behind our forehead, we essentially are bringing that attentional, that perceptual spotlight to a location in which there is no sensation. There's nothing to feel there. And when we do that, by closing our eyes and focusing on that, quote, unquote, third eye center, which is the prefrontal cortex, to be quite honest, when we do that, something else happens. And what happens is when we are not thinking about and perceiving our sensations, because there are none there, our thoughts and our emotions and our memories sort of mushroom up. A better way to put it would be that they geyser up and take on more prominence in our perception. What I mean by this is that normally, you know, I'm not thinking about the contact point between me and this chair, but as I'm speaking, I'm in contact with the chair and those neurons are firing. But if I focus my energy and attention on them, they're going to fire the same but more of my perception goes there. Similarly, I'm thinking things all the time. You are too. And I'm perceiving things all the time, and I'm remembering things all the time, and I'm anticipating things all the time about the future. But by focusing my attention on the one organ for which I have no sensation, that is, my brain, well, then thoughts, feelings, and memories, feelings meaning emotional feelings, start to grow in their prominence in my awareness and in my perception. And so this is why when you sit down to a meditative practice, if it's a meditative practice where you close your eyes or you're focused on that third eye center, where you're focused on your brain as opposed to your bodily surface or something external to you, the thoughts seem to come by in waves, and they can almost be overwhelming. It's very hard to, as it's often described, just sit back and watch your thoughts go by because there are so many of them. Actually, the best way to stop thinking is to really focus on something external or to focus on sensation. That's less thinking than it is perceiving senses, okay? So I don't want this to get too abstract. When people talk about the third eye center, they're not talking about the pineal, they're talking about prefrontal cortex, and when you direct your own attention to the very area of your brain that directs attention, there's nothing to sense there. The only things that will become present to you are feelings, emotions, that is, thoughts and memories, and they will often arrive in what seems to be a very disorganized fashion. And the reason they arrive in somewhat disorganized fashion is because, normally, we just don't perceive things that way. Normally, we are splitting our attention, our perception, that is, to multiple things, our sensation and our thoughts. When we put all of our perception into our thoughts, we see how disorganized, how wandering they are and how, in fact, how random and intrusive those can be. Again, random and intrusive. And much of what we talked about in that paper earlier, the one where they asked people, what are you doing and what are you feeling and how happy or how unhappy you are, what they discovered was that most people are sort of in their head a lot. They're not really present to what they're doing, which leads me to the statement that I believe, at least based on the data, that paper included, that most people have an interoceptive bias. They're focused more on what's going on internally than they are focused on what's happening externally. There are certainly people who for the opposite is true, but I think that this is an issue because we hear so often about the need to do a meditation practice that allows us to focus inward and that we're getting yanked around by all the stressors of life, et cetera, et cetera. And we are, we're getting yanked around by all the stressors and demands of life. But as we do that, we tend to be very focused on what's happening with us. The data clearly point to the fact that being mindful and being aware can enhance one's level of presence and happiness. But we can go so far as to say that being mindful and aware of what's happening, not just with us but external to us in our immediate environment, that includes what other people are saying and doing, that also can really enhance our sense of well-being and happiness. At least that's what the data point to. Let's briefly recap where we've been so far. We've talked a little bit about the brain networks that are activated during meditation, which include prefrontal cortex, ACC, the insula. We also talked about the difference between interoception and exteroception and the importance of assessing where you are along that continuum. And I should mention, of course, that you can be right in the middle of that continuum. You might sit down to do meditation and find that you are smack dab in the middle of being able to attend to things outside of you but also attending to things inside of you. In which case, I suggest doing a meditation that is either exteroceptive-biased or interoceptive-biased. But as I mentioned earlier, if you find that you are more, quote, unquote, in your head or in your body, well, then focus on an exteroceptive-biased meditation to build up that set of circuits. Whereas if you are more exteroceptively focused at any given moment, well, then I encourage you to do an interoceptively focused meditation practice. And as I mentioned earlier, there is this issue of how long to do a practice. There are a lot of different data on these, but some of the practices we've covered on this podcast before when we had guests, for instance, highlighted the 13-minute meditation that Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University's laboratory has popularized, and they popularized it because they have a wonderful paper that we will provide a link to which shows that a daily 13-minute meditation, which is of the traditional third eye, interoceptively biased, focus on breathing, and focus on that location directly behind one's forehead or both, that meditation done daily for about eight weeks, maybe shorter, but in that study, eight weeks, greatly improved mood, improved ability to sleep, improved cognitive ability and focus, memory, a huge number of metrics were looked at very specifically. So that's a terrific one. And you may be asking yourself, do you need to do the full 13 minutes? Could you get away with five minutes or three minutes? Well, my laboratory has shown benefits in stress reduction, improvement in sleep, et cetera, with a five-minute-a-day meditation. However, in trying to establish how long you should meditate, I would ask yourself a couple of questions. First of all, what is a practice that you can do consistently? And by consistently, that doesn't necessarily mean every day. If you answer the question about consistency honestly, and you find that you can only do one meditation session per week, well, then I would encourage you to go a little bit longer, maybe 10 or 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes. Again, understanding that you're going to have to refocus repeatedly throughout that meditation regardless of whether or not you're focusing on internal perceptions or external perceptions. If, however, you can set aside 5 or 10 or 15 minutes per day and you can meditate every day, well, then I think you have a bit more flexibility in terms of how long you meditate. Maybe it's three minutes one day, one minute the next day, 10 minutes the next, and so on and so forth. Just like with exercise, the key component is consistency, and this is borne out in all the data that's covered in \"Altered Traits.\" It's also borne out in all the recent studies that have come out since that book was published. Consistency is key, so ask yourself what you can do consistently, and also don't necessarily burden yourself with always having to do the same amount or duration of meditation. So earlier, we decided we were going to parse or fine slice the meditation practice, and indeed we've been doing that. We've talked about interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias, and we've been talking about where you place your perception or your focus. Another key component of meditation is the pattern of breathing that you embrace. In fact, the pattern of breathing that you embrace during your meditation practice can itself be its own form of meditation. What do I mean by that? Well, these days, we hear a lot about breathwork. Breathwork has really grown in popularity in the last 5, 10 years, and there are a number of reasons for that. First of all, I think we need to credit Wim Hof, or can we call him, I think appropriately, the Great Wim Hof? You know, certainly there were people before Wim who were doing deliberate breathwork and talking about deliberate breathwork, but it was really about 2015 or so that Wim Hof started to grow in recognition and popularity for a particular style of breathing, which, in the laboratory, we call cyclic hyperventilation. I know there are other names for it that come from ancient traditions. He named it, or people named it after him, Wim Hof. Wim Hof, for those of you that don't know, is a Dutchman who is known to hold many world records for deliberate cold exposure, including swimming under icebergs, longest period of time buried in ice up to his neck, et cetera, but who's also expert in the use of breathing in particular ways in order to manage and maneuver through those challenges. And he started speaking about different patterns of breathwork, in particular, the use of cyclic hyperventilation, deep, deliberate breathing, so big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], big inhales [inhales and exhales] exhales. In the laboratory, again, we call that cyclic hyperventilation. It's very clear from studies both done on Wim specifically but on the general population as well by my lab and other labs that that pattern of cyclic hyperventilation, of deliberately breathing deeply and repetitively, typically in through the nose, out through the mouth, generates a lot of adrenaline or causes adrenaline release from the brain and body. It, quote, unquote, heats up the body. Indeed, it raises body temperature, but the liberation of adrenaline does a number of things to shift the state of the brain and body. That, more or less, is what Wim Hof breathing is, although Wim Hof breathing, or some people will call it tummo breathing or cyclic hyperventilation, is not a pattern of breathing typical of most meditations that have been discussed, at least not in the research literature. Now, that's not to say that cyclic hyperventilation can't be incorporated into a meditation practice, but Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic hyperventilation/tummo is typically considered its own practice, okay? Its own breathwork practice divorced from meditation. It might have a meditative component, but it's not often discussed as meditation or as part of meditation. More typically, a meditation practice involves slowing one's breathing, and this could be in the form of cyclic breathing of inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, which is cyclic, or, in some cases, doubling up on inhales and then exhaling, so inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale, exhale, or controlling the duration of inhale, breath hold, exhale, breath hold, repeat, so-called box breathing where the inhale, the hold, the exhale, and the hold are of equivalent durations. Any number of different breathing patterns, slow cyclic breathing, box breathing, a cadence of three to six seconds in, holding for two seconds, and seven seconds out, regardless of what cadence of breathing one uses, there is a tendency during most meditative practices to slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing in deliberate fashion. This is essential because when we default our breathing, that is, when we don't pay attention to how long we are inhaling relative to our exhales, when we don't deliberately exhale, that is, normally we just passively exhale but we actively inhale, I repeat that, normally, when we're not thinking about breathing, we deliberately inhale, there's a a motor command that's sent to inflate the lungs, and then we passively exhale. But in many breathwork practices or meditation practices, we actually actively exhale as well. Well, when we do that, a number of things happen. First of all, it forces us into interoception. Why? Because the diaphragm, the muscle that helps move the lungs essentially and create a specific cadence of breathing or depth of breathing as one would with box breathing or deliberately slow breathing, well, that muscle resides inside of us, and so when we focus on our breathing, more often than not, we aren't focused on the actual air leaving our nasal passages or mouth, maybe a little bit, but more typically, we are forced to focus or we just default to focusing on the movement of our diaphragm or of our belly or the rising and falling of our chest. All of that is to say that by deliberately focusing on our breathing, we shift to interoception. So breathing and specific patterns of breathing are sort of along for the ride in meditation, but the reverse can also be said, that when we focus on our breathing, we shift to interoception and away from external events. It doesn't mean we can't still pay attention to external events, we can still exterocept, but at least some portion of our perception, of our attention shifts to interoception. So we of course need to breathe to stay alive. We have to breathe at least every so often in order to stay alive, so, of course, breathing is part of any meditative practice, just like it's part of any living activity, even sleep. But if the first component of meditation is to direct our perception in a deliberate way, using that prefrontal cortex, to a specific location, either on the surface of or within our body or external to our body, or both, but typically one or the other, then we can say that the second element of a meditative practice is the pattern of breathing, and we can ask ourselves, can it and should it be deliberate or not? In other words, do we just default to however we happen to be breathing, or should it be deliberate? That is, should we be controlling the depth and the cadence? And I do believe that, based on what we know about the capacity for specific patterns of breathing to shift our brain state, that controlling one's pattern of breathing during meditation can be enormously useful, and that is true regardless of whether or not one is focusing on interoceptive perceptions within our body or exteroceptive perceptions. So that raises the question, how should we breathe during meditation? Well, there is, again, no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, but there are some general rules of respiration physiology that can help us access and develop a meditation practice that is going to best serve our goals. And since this is not an episode all about respiration, and we will do one, I simply want to give you the basics of what respiration can do to shift your brain and body state. Before I do that, however, I want to give a very specific instruction, which is when you sit down to meditate, or if you're going to do your meditation walking, that's fine too. I should just say when you are about to begin your meditative practice, you need to ask yourself a question. Do you want to be more relaxed than you are at present, or do you want to be more alert than you are at present when you exit the meditation practice? Do you want to calm down, or do you want to become more alert? Simple question. You can decide from session to session. You could even switch within a session. But just as you need to assess whether or not you are leaning more interoceptively or exteroceptively, you also need to ask yourself, do you need to calm down or want to calm down, or do you want to be more alert at the end of your meditation session? Or maybe you want to go into a state of deep relaxation and then exit with more alertness. The way to do that is very simple using breathwork and specific patterns of breathing. And here is the general rule that is supported by all the respiration physiology that I'm aware of. I'm oversimplifying here, but I'm oversimplifying intentionally so you can simply apply the tool. And then, as I mentioned before, we will do an episode all about respiration physiology in the future. Essentially, if your inhales are longer and/or more vigorous than your exhales, then you will tend to be more alert or you'll shift your brain and body towards a state of more alertness. This is simply based on the way that the neural circuits like the pre-Botzinger nucleus and the parafacial nucleus that govern respiration physiology and alertness, it's simply the way they work. They communicate with brain areas that release noradrenaline and norepinephrine, et cetera. In contrast, if you emphasize longer duration and/or more vigorous exhales relative to your inhales, you will tend to relax more, you will tend to calm your nervous system. Now, you might be saying, \"Okay, I understand what it is to make an inhale longer than my exhale, but how do I make it more vigorous?\" Well, it simply means drawing more air into your lungs more quickly than you allow yourself to exhale that air. So an example of inhale-biased breathwork would be [inhales and exhales] [inhales and exhales], so there's an active emphasis on the inhale, and it's a little bit longer than the exhale which is passive. Conversely, if you want to relax, then you want to extend your exhales relative to your inhales, and you can even make them active exhales. So it can be inhale [inhales and exhales], exhale [inhales and exhales]. That's going to shift your nervous system in a direction of more calm. And, of course, if you would like to stay at the level of alertness aka calmness because those are two sides of the same seesaw or the same continuum, if you'd like to be right where you're at at the end of your meditation as where you started, at least in terms of levels of alertness and calmness, well, then you would just keep your inhales and your exhales relatively balanced in terms of duration. Now, the introduction of things like breath holds with box breathing or Wim Hof breathing, typically, it's 25 or 30 deep inhale, exhales, deep inhale, exhales, and then exhale all your air, hold your breath for 15 to 60 seconds, and then repeat and so on, sometimes some inhales and holds. Well, that's a whole business into itself. But for sake of meditation, the key thing to understand is that if you are going to do a complicated breathing practice, it will, by design, by necessity, shift much of your attention to the breathing practice, especially if it's not cyclic, if it's not inhales follow exhales. Cyclic breathing is where inhales always follow exhales, follow inhales, follow exhales. It actually relies on a specific brain center called the pre-Botzinger complex discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA. He was a guest on this podcast previously. However, if you are doubling up on your inhale, so two inhales [inhaling], and then an exhale [exhales], a pattern of breathing my laboratory has studied extensively, well, then that relies on a different brain center, the parafacial nucleus. The point is that if you are engaging in noncyclic breathing or you are deliberately emphasizing inhales or exhales or the vigor of inhales and exhales, et cetera, well, then some portion of your attention will be devoted to making sure that you follow that breathing practice. We are very good at going into cyclic breathing practices by default, and our attention can drift to other things. Interoceptive or exteroceptive, it doesn't matter, we can just drift into, you know, how our body feels or something we see or hear in the room, et cetera. When we are focused on our breathing and the breathing pattern is noncyclic or complex in some way in that it involves deliberate voluntary commands, again, from those so-called top-down mechanisms of the prefrontal cortex, well, that, by design, requires some portion, often a significant portion of our attention to be devoted to the breathing practice itself. So what does this mean? This means that breathwork itself can be a form of meditation, and meditation can involve breathwork, but one should know that the more deliberate and unnatural that pattern of breathing is, the less you will be able to focus on other things. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. You can actually leverage this. So for instance, if you are somebody who's very much caught in your own head, right, we talked about this earlier, or you're in a moment where you're really stuck in your head and you want to get out of your head, well, then that meditation practice that you do really should be focused on exteroceptive bias, you should really focus on something external to you, and I would encourage you to use a natural cyclic pattern of breathing where inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. If, however, you are finding that you're sort of caught in the landscape of things happening around you and you want to ground yourself, as it's sometimes called... That's a loose language, not a scientific language. I know there's this practice of grounding, and that's a whole thing. People are always writing to me, \"Is grounding a real thing, walking barefoot on the Earth and magnetic fields, you know, and gravitational fields?\" Well, gravity's real, but, you know, grounding, there isn't a lot of science for it, to be frank. It does feel nice to walk on the ground, however. But if you are somebody who's kind of feeling pulled out of yourself a lot or in a moment and you want to bring your awareness into your body and sort of calm down, well, then I would encourage you to, yes, use a deliberate, somewhat unnatural or non-default pattern of breathing, which, by definition, will force you to attend to what's going on interoceptively. Again, I'm not aware of any place that this has been discussed in detail such as this before. If there is a research literature on this, please let me know. My laboratory has been working on this extensively. I'm always looking for new colleagues and collaborators. We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel who's an expert in hypnosis, again, who's been a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast and my colleague at Stanford Psychiatry. In fact, he's our associate chair of psychiatry, world expert in hypnosis, he's been on this podcast before, we have an active research program focused on these issues. We are very much of the belief that a breathwork practice itself can be meditative, a meditation practice can include breathing, but the more that that meditative practice focuses on the breathing itself, the more interoceptive-biased it will be. Now, it's very important to understand that an interoceptive-biased breathwork practice will have a specific effect, which is to make you more interoceptively aware. And if you think back to earlier in the episode, for many people, that will be a wonderful thing and something that they are actively seeking or ought to seek because it can help people gain awareness, for instance, you know, if they're stressed and they're not realizing it till the end of the day, they're just exhausted, more interoceptive awareness throughout the day can be very beneficial. If, however, you are somebody who is overly focused on your bodily sensations, well, then more exteroception awareness is important. And this brings us to a yet larger theme but a theme that I think really emphasizes what particular types of meditative practices are going to be best for certain people, especially people who are using meditation to combat certain challenges, in particular, mood-based challenges or sleep-based challenges or focus-based challenges. I haven't listed off all the positive benefits of meditation yet in this episode, but they are many, many, many. In fact, there are now tens of thousands of scientific studies showing, for instance, there are known benefits of doing meditation for enhancing sleep, there are known benefits of a regular meditation practice for enhancing focus, there are known benefits of a regular meditation practice for reducing inflammatory cytokines, even improving outcomes in cancer, reducing pain, improving mood, reducing the symptoms of ADHD and clinically diagnosed HD and on and on and on. And, again, rather than focus on all those beautiful studies today which all basically point to the fact that some meditation practice done regularly, even if it's very brief, has tremendous, even outsized benefits on our health even relative to some drug treatments, that's been shown. Rather than focus on all that, I've been more focused on what sorts of brain and body changes occur when we do a meditation practice and, perhaps more importantly, what really constitutes a meditation practice. We have this thing about a continuum of perception. We also now are talking about breathing. Well, there's another component that I'd like to raise now, which we could say is the third major component if the first one that I raised was interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias or continuum, the second being breathing, is it going to be default or deliberate breathing? Is it going to be natural cadence or unnatural cadence? Again, no right or wrong, it just depends on what your goal is. There's a third component. This is a component, again, that hasn't really been formalized in the literature but that Dr. Spiegel and I are working hard to formalize through some research and through an upcoming review that we will provide links to once it's out, and that's a separate continuum which is the continuum between interoception and dissociation. So now all of you know what interoception is, but most people probably don't know or don't realize what dissociation is. Often we hear about dissociation, sometimes called disassociation. Some people pronounce it dissociation. Guess what? Despite being corrected many times for each of those pronunciations, I checked with my colleagues who are experts in dissociation or disassociation, and guess what? They're the same thing. Tomato, tomato, potato, potato. So I'm going to say dissociation. Some people will say disassociation, like I disassociate. Other people will say I dissociate, okay? Both of those refer to essentially the same thing. Dissociation is often talked about in the context of a negative event. And indeed, dissociation is unfortunately, or, I should say, is adaptively associated with traumatic events. In particular, violent or sexual trauma, people will report feeling out of body or out of the experience during the experience or during a recollection of the experience. Dissociation has also been described in terms of people who are in a traumatic accident or they see someone killed right in front of them. First responders will talk about dissociating when they arrive on a scene. I don't want to provide, you know, gruesome imagery here 'cause I know people can be pretty sensitive to this, but, you know, showing up on the scene of a car crash and just seeing carnage or incredible damage to bodies or, you know, this sort of thing. Dissociation lies at the opposite end of a continuum with interoception. Now, earlier, I said that interoception is on the opposite end of a continuum with exteroception, but it also is on the opposite end of a continuum with dissociation. We can provide some better definitions perhaps to make this crystal clear, and here, I'm actually reading from an upcoming review. I feel comfortable reading from it because I'm an author on the review. But nonetheless, interoception refers to a process by which your nervous system, meaning your brain and connections with your body, senses, interprets, integrates, and regulates signals originating from within the body, and thereby provides a moment-to-moment mapping of your internal landscape at both a conscious and unconscious level. Okay, that's a lot of words to describe basically the process of perceiving what's happening at the level of the surface of your skin or inward. Dissociation can be thought of as the opposite of interoception. It's a lack of bodily awareness or a removal of one's conscious experience from one's bodily experience and awareness. Again, this is most often talked about in the context of something traumatic, but really, if we think about health and mental health and physical health, the optimal place to reside on the continuum between interoception and dissociation is somewhere in the middle. We don't want to be dissociated from life's experiences, but we also don't want everything that happens in the world to profoundly impact our heart rate and our breathing. We'd be yanked around by every experience. There are instances in which being yanked around or pulled into an experience is something that we desire and want, like seeing a movie that we want to see or, for instance, clinical hypnosis or falling in love, wonderful experiences and sometimes also sad experiences, right? Being able to feel one's feelings depending on life's events is important. But being too dissociated or being too feeling, that is, feeling so much in response to everything that happens is also problematic. There are certain people, for instance, that have challenges with what's called narrative distancing. That is, they see someone in a movie getting hit and they almost flinch as if they are getting hit. They see someone who's scared or happy in a movie and they feel scared or happy in a way that seems like they're along for the ride a little bit too much. This is important because what it speaks to is the ability for that... Remember way back at the beginning of the episode, that ACC, that anterior cingulate cortex and the insula. We've got a prefrontal cortex that can say, hey, let's be rational. That movie, that person who's happy or sad, that person in your environment who's breaking down crying, yes, they're sad, it's important to be sympathetic, maybe even empathic towards them, but let's not get pulled into the experience so much that we lose ourselves. And then of course there are areas of your brain that are also leaning on, and here I'm using metaphor, but they're leaning on the insula and ACC and saying, hey, there's somebody that I care about that's upset, I'm also going to be upset, or somebody I care about is happy, I'm also going to be happy, or they're scared so I'm also going to be scared. So it's a push-pull between our recognition that we are each distinct entities and also, of course, the very healthy desire to be attached to others' experiences and the experiences around us. So why am I raising yet another continuum, right? We already have the one continuum of interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. Well, if we want to think about how meditation can serve our mental health and our ability to focus, there's a very particular mental model that we can arrive at that incorporates this interoceptive-dissociative continuum. Again, if you are extremely interoceptive, you're feeling everything in your body, and those feelings in your body nearly completely account for all of your experience if you're at that far end of the continuum. On the dissociative end of things, you can see what's going on, you can react to what's going on, but your bodily response to that is essentially shut down. You could either be paralyzed shut down, so kind of no movement, or you could still be engaging in behaviors but you're dissociated. Again, sadly, this is often what victims of trauma report, that they are able to just go through the motions but just shut off their emotions or their emotions just shut off. They aren't feeling the elevated heart rate or breathing. Sometimes they can even be quite scared, but they're not even perspiring or showing any signs of autonomic arousal, that is, fright or stress or panic. So let's talk about this model of interoception and dissociation and then a meditative practice that can be used to try and anchor us at the right location or the healthy location along that continuum. Let's first imagine the ideal mental health state. And here, I want to acknowledge, nobody achieves or at least maintains this mental health state. I want you to imagine that where you are along this interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum is like a ball bearing, or you represent a sphere that can roll back and forth along the continuum. At one end, you have pure interoception, you're just feeling everything. At the other end, you're completely dissociated. Well, in this one version of mental health, we take that continuum and we fold up the sides so that it looks like a V, okay? On one end, you have interoception. On the other end, you have dissociation. I realize a number of people are listening to this and not watching this on YouTube so they can't see that my hands are now, the heel of my hands are together, the fingers of my hands are apart so it looks like a V, and you are like a ball bearing. Your state is like a ball bearing at the base of that. You are in a trench of perfectly balanced interoception and dissociation, so you can feel things, you can register what's going on in the outside world, but your feelings are not overwhelmed or overtaken by what's happening in the outside world. You are in a perfect place of being able to make rational decisions and yet still feel your feelings. Wouldn't that be lovely? Wouldn't that be lovely if we could be like that whenever we wanted to? And frankly, nobody is like that all the time. More typically, the model of mental health and mood and well-being and perception of self versus others and internal versus external states is one of more of a U, a U shape, where at one end, we have interoception, and at the other end, we have dissociation, and it's kind of U shaped, and your state is more or less like a ball bearing at the base of that U that, you know, it gets pushed from side to side. Maybe, you know, your heart races a little bit because of something bad or good, and that ball bearing shifts towards interoception a little bit more and you notice that your heart is racing. Or perhaps, at any given moment, you know, your mind drifts a little bit while watching a movie or while talking to your partner or while your child is complaining about something and you're thinking about something else, and that ball bearing shifts towards the dissociative state a little bit. That is a mild form of dissociation. And I think most people would agree that being mentally healthy would involve this kind of U-shaped model as well, where it kind of can shift back and forth, but it's not extreme. You're not going from interoceptive-biased all the way to dissociated in any kind of extreme way. The ball bearing stays down near the base of that U. Then, of course, there are states that we all, frankly, go into from time to time where the continuum of interoception and dissociation is essentially flat, where you are a ball bearing at one location or another, depending on whether or not you're watching a movie that you're very engrossed in or you're in a conversation with or in an activity with your partner or a friend, et cetera, that has you very engrossed, maybe matching their state, right? There are a number of states you can imagine where matching one's state is actually healthy and good, and then there are a number of conditions in life and situations in life where being matched to someone else's condition like you're getting yelled at and they're angry so then you're getting angry, and then pretty soon, you know, you're not in the best place along that continuum. And I think that for many people, they find themselves somewhere along that continuum. And a number of practices, including meditation, including exercise, including getting a good night's sleep, including therapy, including journaling, including just doing activities like social engagement that you enjoy, are designed to sort of bring up the edges of that flat continuum into more of a U or concave shape so that that ball bearing, meaning your state of awareness and your state of feeling your own feelings versus paying attention to what's going on around you, is somewhere, again, biased toward the middle. By curling up the edges of that continuum on either end, it biases that state toward the middle. And then, of course, there's the extreme that I think almost everybody would agree is more or less pathologic, which is one in which that continuum is no longer shaped like a deep trench like a V, it's not shaped like a U, it's not flat with the edges curled up a little bit or even flat. It's actually now convex. It looks like a mountain shape, a peak, and that little ball bearing at the top can either drop all the way to one side of pure interoception, just feeling beyond any ability to pay attention to anything else, just feeling one's feelings, being angry, being sad, or even happy, right? Being so extremely happy or manic that you can't pay attention to the fact that it's totally out of context, right, inappropriate for what's going on around you, or dropping to the other side of the continuum where you're so dissociated that you're not engaged with what's going around you. You're truly, quote, unquote, checked out. That shape is one that I think almost all clinicians, if not all clinicians, and most people would say is pathologic because you are either completely checked out or you are completely absorbed in what's going on within you or around you. That mental model that I just created is a simple mental model. It is by no means exhaustive, but it does incorporate a lot of what we think about when we think about mental health and we talk about the ability to be mentally stable, to feel one's feelings, but to still be actively engaged in what's happening around us. And again, it's a continuum that spans from interoceptive awareness to dissociation where the extremes are pathologic and somewhere in the middle is healthier, and then there are practices that bias us toward being in the middle by default. What are those practices? Well, we know for sure that being sleep deprived, for instance, tends to take us away from that trench shape or U-shape continuum or even flat continuum and starts to make that continuum more convex. It tends to make us either feel like we're completely checked out and exhausted or that we are completely labile, we are yanked around by whatever experience is happening, we are just not able to manage. So sleep is, as I always say, the fundamental or foundational layer of mental health, physical health, and performance because it tends to put us in a healthier place. That is, when we're getting enough quality sleep consistently, it tends to put us in the middle of that continuum. Sleep deprivation does exactly the opposite. It pulls us apart. And when I say pulls us apart, that's not a real term. What it does is it tends to make that continuum less concave, right, less bowl shaped, and more convex, more hill shaped, if not a peak mountain shape where it drops us to one side or the other. In addition, a meditative practice done regularly, because it can allow us to become more interoceptively aware or it can allow us to become more exteroceptively aware, which is really just another form of dissociation, again, dissociation isn't always bad provided it's not at the extreme, a meditative practice can actually teach us to deliberately move along this continuum. So this is something, again, that hasn't been discussed a whole lot in the literature. It's been discussed, I should say, in pieces in different literatures. If you look in the clinical psychiatry literature, there's a wonderful collection of studies and reviews that will say that interoceptive awareness is terrific except for the person that is so aware of their internal functioning that they are not able to engage in the world. Similarly, you'll find a beautiful literature, research and clinical literature, that will say that dissociation is terrible in the case of trauma. In fact, it can put people in positions of repeating a behavior over and over that's damaging to them, but because they can disengage or they're dissociated from it that they continue the behavior, or dissociation can be very adaptive and beneficial if it allows people, for instance, to create some narrative distancing so they're not getting pulled into every argument, or if someone screams at them, they don't necessarily think that it's their fault. They are able to say, \"Hey, wait,\" you know, use their prefrontal cortex and say, \"Hey, wait, like, just because you're upset does not mean that I did something wrong. Let's look at the evidence rationally.\" Okay? So in thinking about the positive effects of meditation on mood, there are two aspects that are important. The first one we talked about earlier, which is being present to one's experience correlates with increased happiness. Having your mind wander, having your default mode network be one of mind wandering actually is correlated with being more unhappy. That was the earlier study that we talked about, that study published in \"Science.\" Now, of course, meditation can make us more present, but if we do not pay attention to whether or not we are becoming more present to interoception or exteroception, that is, to interoception or dissociation, and we don't pay attention to whether or not our bias is one of dissociation versus interoception, we don't know where we are on the continuum, well, then the meditation actually can make things worse, not better. In other words, if you're somebody who has a tremendous amount of interoceptive awareness, well, then meditating on your internal state may not be good, and actually, there's some evidence that it may actually be bad. I'll give you one little tiny example. I've talked about this previously on the podcast, but in that very study from Wendy Suzuki's lab showing that 13-minute-a-day meditation is beneficial for focus, mood, et cetera, it's also very clear that for a number of people that do that typical third eye meditation for 13 minutes a day, if they do that too close to sleep or when they want to go to sleep, they have a hard time falling asleep, which makes perfect sense because they are becoming more interoceptively aware, they are ramping up their level of focus. A meditation practice typically is a focus and refocus practice, and falling asleep involves turning off your thoughts and your focus and focusing purely on sensation, and then your thoughts kind of fragment and you drift off to sleep. This is why I'm a big fan of using non-sleep deep rest or yoga nidra. We will provide links to non-sleep deep rest and yoga nidra protocols. I've talked about them on the podcast before, but those protocols are not meditation per se. They tend to have people defocus, they are anti-focus practices, whereas meditation tends to be a focusing practice. Along those lines, a meditation practice that is one that is exteroceptively biased, where you focus on things that are outside your body, can be wonderful for somebody who tends to focus too much on their inner landscape and their inner narrative, et cetera, it can help get them out of their head and body, which can be very beneficial. But for people that are not in touch with their emotions, aren't in touch with how they feel, it actually can drive them down the exact path that's wrong for them. So today's discussion is about meditation, and we want to make sure that we are parsing meditation in a rational way that matches the neural circuitry involved and, more importantly, for sake of practical purposes, that you are asking yourselves the right question. Are you interoceptively or exteroceptively biased? Do you tend to dissociate, or do you tend to sort of feel everything in a big way, right? I've heard this term of, you know, hypersensitive people or things that sort, and, you know, some of those are clinical terms, some of them are not. But you need to assess this, and you also need to assess where you happen to be at on a given day, which will be dictated, of course, by how well you slept, life experience, et cetera. So this interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum is one that you need to address prior to any meditative practice. And, again, the solution or the answer of what to do in response to your answer of whether or not you are more inward focused or outward focused, again, is very simple. Just do the opposite of where your bias lies. That is, if you're tilted towards interoception, do an exteroceptive focused practice. If you are more dissociative and you're... That sounds sort of pejorative, it sounds bad, right? But, again, if you are somebody who is more focused on events outside your body and you want to gain more interoceptive awareness and feeling state, if you will, well, then you want to do a practice that's third eye center practice or breathing focused. One of the reasons that many people meditate is that they've heard before or they've experienced that meditation can replace sleep or can reduce one's overall sleep need. So that's an interesting set of questions, and it's one that I dove into the literature to pursue an answer to, and I came up with an answer that was frankly a little bit complicated on the face of it but boils down to some very simple protocols that I think any and all of us can leverage in order to sleep better and maybe even reduce the total amount of sleep that we need, something that I think most people would want. You know, I realize that we all probably should enjoy sleeping, I certainly do, but that it's hard to get enough sleep, and wouldn't it be wonderful, for instance, to be able to get by on a little less sleep and still feel alert and rested? First of all, I want to point to the recent study, and, again, this is one that I've raised a few times and we'll post a link to it, entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotion regulation in non-experienced meditators. This is the work, again, from Wendy Suzuki who was a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast, who is now the Dean of Arts and Sciences at New York University and has run a laboratory focused on memory for a long time, is a terrific neuroscientist and researcher and teacher, et cetera, and was a terrific guest on the podcast. I keep returning to this paper because they used so many measures, they were very thorough, and the results were really interesting. Again, this is the 13-minute-a-day guided meditation session. I should just mention that the control group in this study listened to a podcast for 13 minutes that did not improve attention, memory, mood, emotion regulation, et cetera, as much as meditation did, which is not to say that podcasts aren't useful. I won't mention which podcast they used. Fortunately, it was not the Huberman Lab podcast, which I like to think at least increases understanding of certain key concepts of science and science-based tools. You're welcome to look at the paper and see which podcast they used. It's a quite well-known podcast, which is an interesting podcast, but it didn't change the brain in any fundamental way in this 13-minute session, whereas 13 minutes of daily meditation did. And, again, something I mentioned earlier but very important to reemphasize now is that they mentioned that if people in the experiment meditated too close to bedtime, they had trouble sleeping, again, which makes sense because meditation, at least in its most common form, in the form used in this paper, is a focusing and refocusing exercise. Falling asleep involves focusing less. There are other studies, however, that have shown, or that asserted, rather, that doing two 20-minute sessions per day of meditation can reduce the need for sleep. Those results are debated. First of all, understanding what sleep need is is very individual, and determining what people can manage on, meaning some people can manage to get by with six hours of sleep but would do better with eight, some people would actually manage probably better in terms of focusing and alertness if they slept a little bit less because they might be waking up midway through a sleep cycle. If you want to learn more about this, you can check out any one of three different episodes that we've done. One is Master Your Sleep. You can find that at hubermanlab.com. Everything is timestamped in that episode. The other is Perfect Your Sleep. And then, of course, we've done episodes on sleep with expert guests like Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley. All of those can be found at hubermanlab.com in all formats, they're all timestamped. With that said, this assertion that has been made many times over and certainly in the popular press that regular meditation can reduce one's overall sleep need is controversial for the following reason. Some groups find that indeed that is the case, and the interpretation is that the stress reduction that's brought about by regular meditative practice, and in this case, very regular, it tends to be one or, more typically, two 20-minute-per-day meditation sessions. That's quite a lot, I think, for most people. I mean, if you think about 40 minutes, isn't that much time overall, but very few people will stick to that twice a day, 20-minute meditation practice very consistently. Well, the idea is that the stress reduction, which is clear and not debated, brought about by that type of meditation practice is good at offsetting some of the cortisol increases associated with reduced sleep and leading people to be able to function cognitively and physically better on reduced sleep than they would had they not been doing the meditation practice. So the simple way of putting this is that if people meditate regularly, that's reducing stress. The reduction in stress is reducing cortisol. Again, cortisol is healthy, but it should be restricted to early part of the day. You don't want too many peaks in cortisol, especially not late in the day. By meditating, you get the healthy pattern of cortisol release, you sort of inoculate yourself somewhat against the unhealthy pattern of cortisol release, and as a consequence, either the sleep that people get is deeper and/or the total amount of sleep that they need is reduced. Now, a lot of people took that result and interpreted it as saying, well, if you can't sleep, then you can just meditate. So one night, you don't sleep or you have trouble sleeping, you just meditate the next day and you'll be fine. Well, certainly that is not supported by the literature. However, there is a practice, and, again, it's one that I've talked about on this podcast many times before, but if you haven't heard me talk about it, there's a practice called yoga nidra, which literally means yoga sleep. It is a practice of doing not so much a focused meditation, but more of a body scan focusing on the sensation of the body and actually trying to turn off that prefrontal cortex or reduce its activity. Yoga nidra scripts can be found on YouTube and elsewhere. They are paralleled by a similar practice that I've talked a lot about called NSDR, or non-sleep deep rest. I put one out into the world, a short one that's 10 minutes long. You can just simply go to YouTube and put in NSDR and my last name, Huberman, and there's one there. Again, all of this is completely zero-cost. Yoga nidra and NSDR have been shown in a fair number of studies, not as many as been done on traditional meditation, or I should say third eye centered meditation or mindfulness meditation, but have been shown to replenish levels of certain neuromodulators like dopamine and reduce cortisol, reduce a stress hormone at least as much and, by my read of the literature, significantly more than with traditional meditation. And there's a nice paper that we will provide a link to which is entitled Yoga nidra practice shows improvement in sleep in patients with chronic insomnia: A randomized control trial. Basically, this study looks at, as the title suggests, people with chronic insomnia, although the results certainly carry over or would carry over for people who don't have insomnia. The key result, I believe, in this paper, although there are many, is that, quote, \"Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly after yoga nidra.\" What do I mean by that? There was a statistically significant reduction in cortisol levels, the stress hormone, immediately after the yoga nidra practice that we believe would be paralleled by a very similar if not equivalent practice of NSDR. NSDR is a lot like yoga nidra but removes a lot of the kind of, let's just call it the sort of mystical language and the intentions. It focuses more on the physiology and the body scans. You know, I want to acknowledge that yoga nidra has been around for thousands of years and was certainly there before NSDR. I also want to acknowledge that, and this was brought up also in \"Altered Traits,\" that sometimes language can be a barrier toward people embracing practices. In fact, this was recognized by Jon Kabat-Zinn when he created what he called mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, or MBSR, which was simply mindfulness meditation to reduce stress, but he called it MBSR, mindfulness-based stress reduction, as a way to bring it into the clinics that would otherwise perhaps be averse to something called mindfulness meditation. Again, this gets more to the sociology and the cultural aspects than it does to any specific utility of one practice versus another. Here's the takeaway point. If you want to get better at falling and staying asleep or falling back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night or if you are generally challenged with sleep issues, an excellent behavioral practice for which there are terrific data, meaning data that show that a stress hormone, cortisol, can be significantly reduced as well as certain neurotransmitters can be replenished as well as, and this is key and covered in this paper that I've mentioned a few moments ago on yoga nidra, that the total amount of sleep that you need can be reduced, at least somewhat, well, then yoga nidra or an NSDR practice done, frankly, any time of day is going to be beneficial. Whereas if your goal, I believe, is to increase your ability to focus, to improve your mood, and, perhaps most importantly, to be able to maneuver yourself in a deliberate way along that interoceptive-exteroceptive or interoceptive-dissociative continuum that we've talked about so much, and to really shift your default mode network from one of being a mind wanderer to somebody who can focus and who frankly is happier, well, then a more traditional third eye center type meditation or a more traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation would be beneficial. Again, which one of those you choose, either focusing inward or focusing on a point outside of you, again, should be dictated by whether or not you tend to be interoceptively biased or exteroceptively biased. But if you want to get better at sleeping, you want to get better at falling asleep, and you want to replace sleep that you've lost, I put that in quotes so that my colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come after me with... What would you come after me with, Matt? Probably with an alarm clock and, I don't know, blankets and a pillow or something of that sort. In all seriousness, it's very clear that replacing sleep that we've lost is an area of research that's still active and ongoing, but NSDR and yoga nidra are very promising, if not downright useful, for replacing sleep that you've lost. Certainly the small amount of data that exists now point to the fact that they are, not the least of which is a beautiful study published out of Scandinavia showing that a 30-minute yoga nidra aka NSDR practice can replenish levels of dopamine, which puts people in a position to be more action-oriented and focused, et cetera, when they come out of the yoga nidra, so certainly a very useful practice. It's a form of meditation, we could call it meditation-ish, but yoga nidra and NSDR are not typically what people think about when we talk about meditation. Of course, this is an episode about meditation. The reason I bring up yoga nidra and NSDR is that many people meditate to enhance their sleep ability and to reduce their total amount of sleep need. It appears that meditation is probably not ideal for that in comparison to yoga nidra and NSDR, but meditation is excellent, if not superb, for adjusting the default mode network toward more happiness by being more mindful and present and for placing oneself in that healthy model of interoceptive-dissociative continuum. So we've covered a lot of information, and I like to think that I've given you some key decisions to make in developing a meditative practice. The most important one, of course, being what will you do regularly? And maybe you're somebody who just answers that question by saying, \"Look, I'm not going to meditate regularly. I just want to do the thing that's going to allow me to feel rested when I'm tired and is going to allow me to adjust my state of mind when I'm not where I want to be for whatever reason, too anxious or too exhausted, et cetera.\" And for those people, I would say a practice like NSDR or yoga nidra will be immensely beneficial, as will a more traditional form of meditation. I also want to just remind everybody that an app that guides meditation, also with some information and some intention setting, such as the Waking Up app from Sam Harris can be immensely beneficial. I've certainly found it to be beneficial. I know millions of other people have as well, so I encourage you to check that out. We've talked about determining where you are on these continuums of interoception and exteroception in order to dictate what particular type of meditation practice you should do in a given moment, whether or not you should focus your vision inward with eyes closed or focus your vision and your attention outward being a key component, whether or not you should do cyclic breathing, which will allow your focus to be off your breathing somewhat easier than if you do non-cyclic breathing, if you're doubling up on inhales or exhales, whether or not your breathing is going to be natural or not. And, of course, you need to determine whether or not your meditation practice is designed to enhance your level of focus or to relax you. I would say that if it's designed to enhance your level of focus, that doesn't necessarily mean that it won't be relaxing. You could do slow cadence breathing and third eye meditation, it could be very relaxing, and yet it's a focus and refocus practice, whereas something like yoga nidra and NSDR is going to be more along the lines of replenishing yourself, replacing sleep that you've lost, or maybe even reducing your sleep need. On previous podcasts, I've talked about hypnosis, and particularly the episode with Dr. David Spiegel, our associate chair of psychiatry. I don't want to get into hypnosis now, but just understand that hypnosis is distinct from breathwork, from yoga nidra, from NSDR, and from meditation even though it includes some of those components like focusing your attention, it involves actually directing your visual attention outward then inward to go into the hypnosis, it involves some breathing of a particular kind, it involves a specific imagery, et cetera. But hypnosis is distinct because hypnosis is really designed to fix or address a specific problem, whereas meditation, NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, typically are not. They can help fix problems such as anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, but they generally are not directed toward a particular line of thinking. They can be, but typically they are not. Whereas hypnosis almost always, especially in the clinical context, not stage hypnosis, but the clinical context for which there's a lot of research to show it can, for instance, help with quitting smoking, literally a quadrupling of the effectiveness for smoking cessation with something like the Reveri app than if people just try and go cold turkey or for reducing insomnia or for reducing pain or for any number of things, including trauma, et cetera, hypnosis is really great at dealing with specific issues and problems and tackling those. Meditation tends to be focused on other things, no pun intended. I'm guessing some of you are probably wondering where to start or, if you're already an avid meditator, where to go with all this information. For that reason, I just wanted to offer you a particular form of meditation that incorporates all of the features that I've talked about up until now in a single meditation practice, and it's a meditation practice that, for lack of a better name, I called STB, or Space-Time Bridging. And the time component has to do with a very simple fact, which is when we focus our attention, visual attention or otherwise, on things close to or within our body, we tend to be fine slicing time. You could sort of think of your breath as more or less the second hands on your clock of existence, whereas when we tend to focus on things far away from us, we tend to parse or carve up time within bigger bins. If you've ever seen a airplane flying at a distance, it looks like it's moving very, very slowly. If you were right up next to that airplane, it's probably going 500 or 600 miles an hour, it would go by very quickly. This is not a coincidence. Believe it or not, how you slice the time domain of your life and your experience has everything to do with your vision, and the closer things are, the more finely you slice up time. The more closely your attention is placed on yourself, the more closely you slice up time. If you focus your visual attention very far or you think about the other side of the world, for instance, and you envision that, well, then you're actually slicing time more broadly. Hopefully that makes sense. Fine slicing would be like slow motion, higher frame rate. Looking in the distance, you're actually taking bigger time bins. So even though things look like they're moving more slowly, it's because your fidelity, your precision of measuring time is actually not as good. It's as if you only have the hours hand on the clock so it seems like it moves very slowly. Hopefully that makes sense to you. So there's a meditation practice that I call Space-Time Bridging that incorporates everything that I've talked about today. It balances interoception and exteroception, it balances interoception and dissociation, and it crosses the various time domains that the brain can encompass using vision. And it's a very simple meditation, it's one that I've been doing for years, and it's one that we're starting to do some research on, but I'm just going to share with you because I think it's actually quite fun and can be quite informative. In fact, people have told me that it can even lead to some interesting insights both during the meditation and outside the meditation. It's very simple, what you do, ideally you would do this outside or at a window, but what you do is you essentially close your eyes. I'm not going to do this now, I'm not going to close my eyes and do the meditation, but I'll describe it. You close your eyes and you focus your attention either on your third eye center or your breathing, and you try and put 100% of your perceptual awareness onto your breathing or your third eye center for the duration of three breaths, okay? So you're 100% or trying to be 100% in interoception. Then you open your eyes, you focus on the surface of your body someplace. I find that holding out my hand at sort of arm's distance and focusing on the palm of my hand and focusing there visually, so I'm splitting my attention now between my hand, and I'm also going to pay attention to my breath for the duration of three full inhales and exhales while also focusing on my hand, so you're splitting interoception and exteroception as best you can, about 50/50. Then you subsequently look at some location in your immediate environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, and you focus your attention on that location while also splitting your attention so that you're still paying attention to your breathing, you do that for the duration of three breaths, but now you are in exteroception and interoception. Then you focus your attention at some distance further away, maybe the furthest distance you can see. Now, this is why it's useful to do out of a window or on a balcony or outdoors. You focus on the furthest point, maybe a horizon, some furthest point for the duration of three breaths while also paying attention to your breathing, and sort of imagine a bridge between the two if you find it to be challenging to focus on both. And then, and this is where it can be a little tricky, but then what you actually focus on is the fact, and this is not an imaginary thing, this is a fact that you are a tiny spec on this big ball that's floating out in space, right? The Earth that's floating out in space. And you try and focus on your three breaths while also acknowledging that you are a small body, literally, on this very seemingly large body, the Earth, but that's floating in a much larger, larger, expansive place, the universe, and you do that for three breaths. And then you close your eyes and you go right back into interoception, and you do that for three breaths. You focus on your interoception for three breaths. And you might want to march through these different locations a few times or back and forth if you like, but typically, I will just do it for one segment at pure interoception, palm of hand, some distance in front of me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back into body, et cetera. Why is this useful? Why would this be useful? Is it at all interesting, or is this just some crazy idea? Well, the reason it's useful, I believe, is that it has you deliberately step your awareness, your perception through every position along that interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. Now, I did say to remain connected to, as they'll say in the yoga classes, aware of, I guess would be the more scientific way to state it, aware of one's breath, but if you wanted, you could actually try and put your awareness completely outside yourself, but most people will find that challenging to do if they're already paying attention to their breath. It's just hard to do, so I find it easier to just split my awareness from interoception to exteroception. But by stepping through these different locations and then deliberately placing your perception, your awareness back into pure interoception, what you do is you essentially are practicing or exercising this incredible ability that the human mind has to deliberately place your perception at specific locations along the interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. And I think this is very useful because many of us, including myself, tend to get locked at one location along that continuum. For instance, if you're scrolling your phone for a long period of time, you may forget about your bodily sensations, but you generally forget about other things going on in the world. Or if you're very focused on things out in the world, you oftentimes can forget about your internal sensations and what's going on internally. And being functional in work, in life, in relationship, and in all aspects, including your ability to fall asleep, involves stepping yourself along these different locations, which, again, are not just physical locations of third eye center or your breathing or your hand or horizon. Those are just stations within space. But remember, each one of those, just by way of how your visual system and the time domain are interlocked with one another, sets your mind in a particular time domain. And so much of what involves being a functional human being involves dynamically adjusting our attention from what we are doing on our computer to a question somebody asks and then back again, or from text messaging to listening to a lecture or a podcast or from listening to a lecture or podcast and then going back into a mode of commuting, but making that commute either relaxing or maybe do work on your commute or connect with family or friends, et cetera. So much of the fatigue of life and the, I should say, the maladaptive behaviors and emotions that show up in life are really not about any set of behaviors or emotions being wrong or right, but rather inappropriately matched to the space-time domain that we're in, which, again, is just fancy nerd speak for saying being present and being mindful is a wonderful byproduct of a meditation practice, but it is but one of those stations along that space-time continuum. The key element here is to step yourself through a practice deliberately so that you are flexibly and dynamically able to engage in conversation, then disengage and focus, or focus and then disengage from the work you're focusing on and actually have a conversation or be in the world and move out of that interoceptive awareness to one in which you are dynamically engaged with the things around you. I realize this might sound a little bit vague. For that reason, I encourage you not to think about it too much, but rather to try the practice, see if it works for you. If it doesn't, that's fine. I think it is a good one for people that find that a third eye center or breathing-focused interoceptive meditation might be enjoyable to them or very beneficial to them, but they might want to try something new, and other people who might find that that tends to put them too much in their own head. I think it also ought to be very useful for people that tend to be overly exteroceptive, more on the dissociative end of the continuum, and need to bring in a bit more of interoceptive awareness, but either can't do that or are uncomfortable doing that because they're simply not interested in or comfortable with feeling so much of their internal state because that can either be overwhelming or that's just simply not the way they want to feel. Now, as we round up, I do want to acknowledge that there are an enormous number of rooms within the house, or rather, I should say, within the castle that is meditation, including, for instance, intention setting and mantras and an enormous number of different features of meditation practices that we simply did not have time to go into and/or for which the research on is not completely ironed out yet. And for that reason, in future episodes in not long from now, I'm going to be sitting down with experts in meditation that include neuroscientists and clinicians, but other experts in meditation that certainly are versed in those topics, and where they can't point to specific research studies can certainly point us toward the utility of things like mantras and intentions as they relate to getting the most out of a meditative practice, so I eagerly await those conversations, and I hope you will join me for those as well.

    "summary": "Meditation is a popular practice that has been shown to have many benefits, including reducing stress and anxiety, improving sleep, and even boosting the immune system. There are many different types of meditation, including mindfulness, which focuses on being present in the moment, and guided meditation, which uses a script or audio track to guide the practitioner through the session. One of the key components of meditation is the pattern of breathing that the practitioner adopts. Breathing patterns can be used to calm the mind and body or to increase alertness. Another key component of meditation is the focus of attention, which can be either internal or external. Some people may find that they are more focused on their internal state, while others may be more focused on external events. It is important to find a meditation practice that works for the individual.\nMeditation is a powerful tool for improving mental health and focus. However, the type of meditation that is best for each person depends on their individual needs and preferences. In this episode, Dr. Kelli explores the science behind meditation and how it can be used to improve mental health and focus. She also discusses the importance of determining where a person is on the continuum of interoception and exteroception and how this can dictate the type of meditation practice that is most beneficial. She also introduces a new meditation practice called \"Space-Time Bridging\" that incorporates elements of all types of meditation.\n",

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Dr. Nolan Williams. Dr. Williams is a medical doctor and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. His laboratory and clinic focus on depression and other mood disorders. They focus specifically on the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation, which is a brain stimulation technique that can either activate or quiet specific brain circuits, as well as circuits within the body, in order to treat depression and other mood disorders. Other laboratories and clinics use TMS. What sets apart the work of Nolan Williams and colleagues is that they combine TMS with other treatments, and some of those treatments are among the more cutting edge that you've probably heard about these days, including ibogaine, psilocybin, MDMA, cannabis, DMT, and other drugs that at this point in time are experimental in terms of clinical trials, but that at least the preliminary data show hold great promise for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. In the course of my discussion with Dr. Williams, we covered things such as the history of each of these drugs, how they came to be, and their current status in terms of their clinical use and legality. We also talk about their safety profiles both in children and in adults, and we talk about what the future of psychedelic research and clinical use really looks like. For instance, we discuss how a number of laboratories and clinics are modifying psychedelics to remove some of their hallucinogenic properties while maintaining some of their antidepressant or anti trauma properties. You'll also learn about some fascinating research in Dr. Williams' laboratory focused on ketamine, which is a drug that is increasingly being used to treat depression. And contrary to common belief, the effects of ketamine in terms of relieving depression may not actually arise from its dissociative effects. One thing that you'll find extraordinary about Dr. Williams is that not only does he have vast knowledge of the various treatments for depression, but that he and his laboratory are really combining these treatments in the most potent way. That is, combining psychedelic treatments with brain-machine interface, or combining brain-machine interface with particular learning protocols. That is, neuroplasticity protocols, which can directly change the brain in specific ways. So today you're going to learn a tremendous amount about the neural circuitry underlying depression, as well as positive moods. You'll also learn about all the various drugs that I described, and you're really going to learn about the current status and future of the treatment of mood disorders. Today, you'll also learn about a number of ongoing studies in Dr. Williams' laboratory. I should mention that they are recruiting subjects for these studies. If you go to BSL, which stands for Brain Stimulation Laboratory, so that's bsl.stanford.edu, you have the opportunity to apply for one of these clinical trials for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. I confess that the conversation with Dr. Williams was, for me, one of the more stimulating and informative conversations I've ever had about psychedelics, which is simply to say that his breadth and depth of knowledge on that topic is incredible, and his breadth and depth of knowledge in terms of the underlying brain science and how it can all be combined with clinical applications is also extraordinary. I'm sure that by the end of today's episode, you're going to come away with a tremendous amount of knowledge about the clinical and non-clinical uses of those substances, and you're going to understand a lot more about how the healthy and diseased brain work. I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast has now launched a premium channel. I want to be very clear that the Huberman Lab Podcast will continue to be released every Monday at zero cost to consumer and there will be no change in the format of these podcasts. The premium channel is a response to the many questions we get about specific topics, and it will allow me to really drill deep into specific answers related to those topics. So once a month, I'm going to host an ask me anything, so called AMA, where you can ask me anything about specific topics covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast, and I will answer those questions. Those of course will be recorded. There will also be other premium content available to premium subscribers, such as transcripts and short videos of new tools and unique tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you want to check out the premium channel, you can go to hubermanlab.com/premium. There is a $10 a month charge or $100 per year, and I should mention that a large portion of the proceeds from the Huberman Lab premium channel will go to support scientific research that develops the very sorts of tools that we talk about on the Huberman Lab Podcast. The rest of the support for the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel will go to supporting the regular Huberman Lab Podcast. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed with a quality blood test. One problem with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests, however, is you get data back about levels of metabolic factors, levels of hormones, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes interpreting your data and knowing what to do about it exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform where you can go and you can see those levels of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera, and they point to specific nutritional tools, behavioral tools, supplement based tools, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to InsideTracker.com/Huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's InsideTracker.com/Huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover a few months ago, and it is simply incredible. In fact, I don't even like traveling anymore because they don't have Eight Sleep mattress covers in hotels and Airbnbs. One of the reasons I love my Eight Sleep mattress cover so much is that, as you may have heard before on this podcast or elsewhere, in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, you need your body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees. And I tend to run warm at night, which makes it hard to sleep and sometimes wakes me up in the middle of the night. When you sleep on an Eight Sleep mattress cover, you can program the temperature of that mattress cover for specific times in the early, middle, and late part of your night so that the mattress stays cool. And as a consequence, you sleep very, very deeply. It also tracks your sleep, so it's paying attention to how many times you're moving, how deep your sleep is. It gives you a sleep score, all wonderful data to help you enhance your sleep. And of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance, which makes an Eight Sleep a terrific tool for enhancing not just your sleep, but all aspects of your life really. If you're interested in trying a Eight Sleep mattress cover, you can go to EightSleep.com/Huberman to check out the Pod 3 cover, and you can save $150 at checkout. Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, to Canada, the UK, and select countries in the EU and Australia. Again, that's EightSleep.com/Huberman to save $150 at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two all American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with some pretty significant challenges in order to be able to see clearly as you move from one area to the next. For instance, when you go from a shady area to a bright area. ROKA understands this and have designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses accordingly so you always see with crystal clarity. In addition, because they were initially designed for performance, things like running and biking, they're extremely lightweight, but they have a terrific aesthetic. So unlike a lot of eyeglasses and sunglasses that were designed for sports and make you look like a cyborg, they have styles that make you look like a cyborg if you like those, but they also have styles that you'd be perfectly comfortable wearing to work or out to dinner, et cetera. They're really terrific glasses. I love mine because I can wear them anywhere and I also use them when running and going out hiking, et cetera. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to ROKA, that's ROKA.com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's ROKA, ROKA.com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout. On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them. Things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep, or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability, or for enhancing energy or adjusting hormone levels to optimal range for you. The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous supplements. To find the supplements we discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, you can go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S, livemomentous.com/huberman. And I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with Dr. Nolan Williams. Thanks for joining today. I'm really excited to have this conversation. It's been a long time coming and I have a lot of questions about different compounds, psychedelics in particular. - Yeah. - But before we get into that discussion, I want to ask you about depression, broadly speaking. Intractable depression. How common depression is or isn't. I heard you say in a wonderful talk that you gave, that depression is perhaps the most debilitating condition worldwide. And yet, in contrast to other medical conditions like cancer, we actually have a fairly limited number of tools to approach depression. And yet number of tools and the potency of those tools is growing. So if you could educate us on depression, I would really appreciate it. - Yeah, absolutely. So depression is a condition that, it has a lot of manifestations, you know. So you can have kind of a depression that's primarily loss of interest. You can have folks who feel very anxious and they're kind of overactive. You can have people who don't have any anxiety at all, and they're very underactive and they have low motivation to do anything. You know, so you have this huge range of symptoms that are in that umbrella of depression. And some of our work is to actually work with folks like Conor Liston and Cornell, and try to actually get biotypes based off of neuroimaging to see if we can kind of parse out the different depression kind of presentations, and see that clinically, and also see that in the brain. Depression is the most disabling condition worldwide. What's interesting about depression is it's both a risk factor for other illnesses, and it makes other medical and psychiatric illnesses worse, right? So recently the American Heart Association added depression as the fourth major risk factor for coronary artery disease, right? So alongside the risk factors that we know, hypertension, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol, and diabetes, you know, high blood sugar, those three have been on the list for a long time and depression ended up being added to the list as the fourth one. And you know, really interesting, right? So in addition to taking medications to address those other three risk factors, we really have to be thinking about how do you treat folks with depression to reduce the risk of having a heart attack in the future? And, you know, there's some of that's being worked on now, but we don't have a complete solution to thinking about that at this time. And then the other thing that's interesting is once you have a heart attack, in the individuals that end up having a heart attack, the risk of having depression after the heart attack is higher than the normal population, right? And so a lot of what we're doing in the lab actually is measuring kind of brain heart connections. And we can actually, with transcranial magnetic stimulation, a form of brain stimulation, we can actually decelerate the heart rate and capture that heart rate deceleration over the mood regulatory regions. And so actually a direct probe of that connection. So it's interesting. And so, you know, as you said a second ago, you know, it's a very disabling condition. Moderate depression's about as disabling as having a heart attack, acutely having a heart attack. Severe depression is disabling, is having cancer without treatment, you know, and dying from a cancer without treatment. And so, you know, it's kind of underappreciated just how disabling depression is in that way. And I think important as stigma is consistently kind of being reduced over the years for mental illnesses, then the idea that we can start really putting more funding and putting more focus at the federal level, you know, private foundation level, whatever it is, at a given university to thinking about developing treatments. We've been very interested in a very particular clinical set of problems around the most severe and the most high acuity settings that folks with depression end up being in. And that's in, you know, emergency settings where they go into inpatient units. And you know, in the rest of medicine, if it's talking about heart attacks, if I start having chest pain right now and you bring me to a primary care doctor's office, they're going to have a certain number of tests and treatments, right? But very limited cuz it's an outpatient facility. If you bring me to the emergency room after that, there are more tests and more treatments. If you put me in the ICU or in the cath lab where they do invasive procedures to the heart, there are more tests and more treatments. In psychiatry, as we elevate the acuity of an individual, you go from being just depressed to being depressed and now thinking about ending your life, the number of treatments actually go down on average. I mean, in some scenarios, they go up, but on average they go down and there are no tests, right? And so we've been very focused on that particular problem. Somebody that maybe was doing, you know, fairly okay with a pretty moderate depression and then their depression gets worse and then they end up in an emergency setting. And the field really hasn't developed a way of consistently being able to treat that problem and folks end up getting the same standard oral antidepressants that they've been getting outpatient. And I came to this because I, you know, dual trained as a neurologist and psychiatrist, went back and forth between neurology and psychiatry, saw that in neurology we have all of these ways of treating acute brain based problems and really wanted to emulate that in psychiatry and find ways to develop and engineer new, you know, brain based solutions. - There's a lot to unpack there. One thing that you said is, I'd like to focus on a bit more because I think we hear that the brain and the heart are connected, but you described, I believe, a direct relationship between areas of the brain associated with emotion and heart rate. - [Nolan] Yes. - And that makes perfect logical sense to me. But I think at the same time, many people out there probably think of the relationship between the heart and the mind as kind of woo or kind of a soft biology. But here you're talking about an actual physical connection. - [Nolan] Yep. - Between, what area of the brain is it? - The first place where the stimulation goes is called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It's kind of the sense of control, kind of governor of the brain. And then what we know is that when you use a magnet, use kind of what we call Faraday's Law, this idea of using a magnetic pulse to induce an electrical current and electrically conducting substances. So in this case, brain tissue, but not skull or scalp or any of that, or hair. You avoid all that, just the brain tissue. Then you have a direct depolarization of cortical neurons, you know, the surface of the brain's neurons, in this dorsolateral prefrontal. And if you do that in the actual scanner, which we can do, you can see that that distributes down into the anterior cingulate and the insula and the amygdala. And ultimately the tract goes into something called the nucleus tractus solitarius and ultimately into the vagus nerve into the heart. So the heart very consistently seems to be the end organ of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. If you measure heart rate in standard ways that cardiologists measure heart rate and you stimulate over this left dorsolateral, you get a deceleration of the heart rate and it's very time locked to the stimulation. So it's a two second train of stimulation. At one second, you see the deceleration, it goes down about 10 beats per minute, and then it'll drift back up and there's a break for eight seconds on the stimulation. Drifts back up and the stimulation goes back in and then the heart rate goes back down. And so you see the heart rate just do this, 10 beats per minute every train. And so we know, and if you do that over visual cortex, you don't get that, or motor cortex, you don't get any of those findings. It's really specific to this kind of control region of the brain. And so, yeah, it seems to, you know, it's our work, other folks' work. Martin Arens in Europe, the Netherlands, work showing the same connections. I think it's been replicated like four or five times. - So you mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Anytime I hear about lateralization of function, I get particularly curious because obviously we have two mirror symmetric sides of the brain. There are, you know, rare exceptions to this, like the pineal and things of that sort that there is only one pineal. What is special about the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? Does this have anything to do with handedness, right hand or left hand? Because we know right-hand and left-handedness has a lot to do with lateralization of function for language, a topic for another time. But why do you think that left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex would be connected to the heart in this way? - Yeah. Yeah, I think, so left dorsolateral is thought to be the side that when you excite it, when you kind of do excitatory stimulation, potentiating sort of stimulation, that you can reduce depressive symptoms. And a guy by the name of Mike Fox at Harvard demonstrated that if you have strokes in the brain that cause depression and you put them on the human connectome, a hundred, you know, thousand patient map, and you ask the question what they're all functionally connected to? Left dorsolateral. If you take lesions that cause mania in individuals and you put those all on the human connectome map and ask what the one common area they're all connected to, it's the right dorsolateral. And so there seems to be a hemispheric, you know, balancing of mood between these two brain regions. And we know this from an experimental standpoint too, because you can take individuals with depression and you can excite the left or you can inhibit the right and they're both antidepressant. You can excite the right and that's anti-manic in some studies. And so this idea that there is this hemispheric balancing of mood is quite interesting, right? - It's incredibly interesting. And just so people know, if you're curious what the connectome is, connectome is a term that was built out of this notion of genomes being large collections of sequencing and mapping of genes. They're proteomes of proteins, of connectomes is so-called connectomics, of connections between neurons. So the Human Connectome Project is ongoing and I find that incredible that within the Connectome Project, they can identify these regularities of right versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Especially since I've looked at a fair number of brains from humans, certainly not as many as you have. And if you look at the architecture, the layers, the cell types, and even the neurochemicals of which cells are expressing, say, dopamine or serotonin or receiving input from areas that make dopamine or serotonin, they don't look that different on the right and left side. And yet here we're talking about a kind of an accelerator and a brake, if you will, on depression and mania using what, at least by my eye and I think other people's eye look to be basically the same set of of bits. The same parts list, more or less. So what gives these properties to the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? Is it the inputs they receive? Is this something that we learn during development or do you think that we come into the world with these hemispheric biases? - Yeah, it's a great question. And you know, it hasn't been worked out, which your original question was around, in a left handed individual, which as you know, 25% of those folks end up having a right brain dominance or 1% of right-handed people have a right brain dominance if it's flipped, right? And unfortunately that study still hasn't been done at the level, 'cause that would be probably pretty helpful for teasing some of this out. But, you know, it's still being sorted out, right? We know enough to know this phenomenon exists because we can use TMS as a probe and do these sorts of manipulations. But to my knowledge, there hasn't been anybody that's gotten so interested in it that they've been able to get a mechanism of why that is. But, you know, it's kind of empirically true in the sense that you can push and pull on those systems, or in the case of strokes that folks have, and then you kind of get their brains and their brain images and look at where the strokes landed, those kind of causal bits of information point to this asymmetry. - Interesting. Well, in that case, going with what we do know, that stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows the heart rate down, transiently, but it slows it down, and seems to alleviate at least some symptoms of depression, leads me to the question of why would that be the case? Does it tell us anything fundamental about depression that anxiety is inherent to depression? I think a faster heart rate is, you know, part and parcel with anxiety. In my laboratory, we've studied fear a bit in animals and in humans, and we often observe bradycardia where somebody or an animal is afraid of something and rather than the heart rate speeding up, it actually slows down, something that most people don't think about or recognize. But given that stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows the heart rate down and can alleviate depressive symptoms and that there are other ways to slow the heart down, I have two questions. What do you think this tells us about the basic architecture of depression and its physiology at the level of the heart? And does the circuit run in the opposite direction too? If one were to have or find other ways to slow the heart rate down, say with a beta blocker, does that help alleviate depression? - Yeah, no, that's a great question. So I'll answer the second question first. So we know that in the ongoing trials of this, if you stimulate in the vagus nerve, in an implanted vagus nerve stimulator, you can actually, you know, have this, the afferent parts of the vagus project ultimately up to the DLPFC through the cingulate through these anterior insula, so that same, that obviously the same tract, right? And you can stimulate there and alleviate depression, which seems very unusual, right? You're stimulating a cranial nerve down on the neck. But if you can get up into the brain, you actually can improve depressive symptoms. And so, you know, more evidence that this is a kind of a whole track and system. And if you stimulate in part of that system, it appears that you can improve mood. - And what if I were somebody who did not have a stimulating electrode in my vagus nerve and I was dealing with minor depression and I decided I wanted to take some other approach to slow my heart rate down by the vagus? For instance, exhale emphasized breathing or deliberately slow cadence breathing, things of that sort. Is there any evidence that behavioral interventions of those kinds can alleviate depression or some symptoms of depression? And is there any evidence that it does indeed feed back to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to achieve some of that alleviation? - Absolutely, yeah. So there's a number of studies implicating the dorsolateral in, say, you know, meditation, mindfulness, that sort of thing. And they're small studies, but pretty well designed studies suggesting that behavioral interventions in mild depression actually work quite well. There seems to be a volitional threshold for depression where at some point you start losing, you go from being completely in total volition to having kind of semi-volition. You have thoughts that you really have a hard time controlling and that sort of thing. And when you go through that threshold, at some point it gets harder and harder for those sorts of things to kind of kick in and work. And the extreme form of that is catatonia, right? Where people in a very severe form of depression get kind of stuck motorically, right? And they obviously can't, they have no control or very limited control. And so, you know, I think there's a threshold in which these sorts of interventions will work. Exercise seems to really be a good treatment for mild depression and it may work through the mechanism you're describing, right? As we all know, you know, athletes hold a lower resting heart rate than folks that aren't, you know, if you were an athlete, you had a lower resting heart rate, you stopped exercising, and a couple years later your resting heart rate in many cases goes up, right? And so maybe that's part of the process. I'm not aware of any studies specifically looking at dorsolateral prefrontal physiology pre-post exercise, but it would be a great study. I think that would be really helpful to understanding this, especially if you had a correlation of changes in kind of lowering of, say, heart rate with mood improvements. There's been a lot of work with heart rate variability and depression and, you know, studies kind of point towards it. Not every study is positive for this, but quite a few studies say basically that lower heart rate variability is associated with, you know, moderate to severe depression. And that may be part of that mechanism of that heart brain risk. - So I'm both intrigued and a little bit perplexed by this relationship between heart rate and depression. On the face of it, I would think of depression as depressed. So lower heart rate might make somebody more depressed. You even mentioned catatonia or somebody that just doesn't seem motivated or excited to do anything. I think of mania as elevated heart rate and being excited. On the other hand, I realize that anxiety, which you know, brings about ideas as elevated heart rate is also built into depression. Which brings me back to what you said earlier, which is that when we say depression, are we really talking about four or five different? - Yeah, that's right. - Disorders, for lack of a better word. And for what percentage of people that have depression does some approach to reducing heart rate work? Whether or not it's stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation or by taking a beta blocker or by stimulating the vagus. Can we throw out a number, a rough number? Does that help, 30%, 50%? How long lasting is that relief? - Yeah, and to be clear, the deceleration of the heart rate is in the moment when the stimulation is happening, but it's not something that's necessarily maintained chronically. It's more of an indicator that you're in the right network more than it appears to be itself, you know, central to the mechanism. The heart rate variability piece may be, and there's some studies that link the two, but the actual deceleration seems to be much more of a marker that you're in the right system. But you know, it very well could be that the heart rate system and the mood system just sit next to each other and the stimulation hits both. If you look at how much of the variance in the mood is explained by the heart rate deceleration, it's not a huge amount, right? So it only explains a small percentage. And so it's unlikely that simply reducing the heart rate. And in fact, you know, for many years, propranolol and these sorts of drugs actually were implicating causing depression. And so that's been kind of debunked, but it's unlikely that simply decelerating the heart rate's going to improve depression. But what it does tell you is that if you're in that area that is the mood regulatory area, there's some parasympathetic cortical kind of process that's going on that gets in and causes this to happen. And it's, you know, it's independent of mood. You can take a normal healthy individual and you can do this and they're going to decelerate their heart rate. - I'm so glad you mentioned the parasympathetic nervous system, which of course is the, most people think of as the rest and digest or the kind of calming side of the autonomic nervous system. As I'm hearing you say all of this, and in particular what you just told me, which is that it's not as if having a lower heart rate protects you against depression or a higher heart rate is associated with depression, although at the extremes that might be true, but rather it's something about the regulatory network, the ability to control your own nervous system to some extent. And when I think about the autonomic nervous system, I like to think about it as a seesaw of, you know, alertness and calmness, and when you're asleep it's a lot of calmness, and when you're panicking it's a lot of alertness to the... But that, and I don't think this has ever been defined, and when I teach the medical students at Stanford neuroanatomy, my wish is that someday I'll be able to explain what the hinge in that process would be, right? Not the ends of the seesaw. We know what the sympathetic nervous system is and it's to wake us up and make us panic or make us feel nicely alert and calm. We know what puts someone into sleep or a coma or makes them feel relaxed. But what shifts from one side of the seesaw to the other and the tightness of that hinge seems to be what you're describing, that depression is sort of a lack of control over inner state so that when I'm stressed, I can't get myself out of it. But when I'm feeling completely collapsed with exhaustion, I can't get out of bed and be motivated to do the very things that would help me get out of depression, like a workout or social connection or eat a quality meal, these kinds of things. So this is perhaps the first time that I've ever heard about a potential circuit for the hinge, as I'm referring to it. Does that make any sense at all? - [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. - Okay, I just want to make sure that I'm framing this correctly in my mind. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And in some studies, if you do the same identical stimulation on the right dorsolateral, you can get an acceleration. You know, just kind of further confirming this idea of lateralization, right? That it appears that even the prefrontal cortex, you know, cortical areas seem to be lateralized in this way. And, you know, it's less, the right finding is more variable depending upon the study. The left's very consistent in this way. So... - So we've talked about transcranial magnetic stimulation for getting into these networks and I also just want to take a brief tangent and say, 'cause I've heard you say this before, I think it's so vital what you're saying, that it's really not about stimulation of areas or any specific brain area or vagus nerve being important per se. It's really about a network, a connection, a series of connections. I think that's really important for people to understand and is kind of a new emerging theme really. The other thing that to me seems extremely important for us to consider is what are these lateral prefrontal cortices doing? Are they involved, for instance, in sensation, sensing the heart rate? Are they involved in thinking and planning? And this gets down to a very simple question that I know a lot of people have, which is, can we talk ourselves out of depression? If it's mild. Can we talk ourselves into a manic state or an excited state, a positively excited state that doesn't qualify as mania? You know, other areas of the brain, I think of is responsible for perception or for motor control. But here we are in this mysterious frontal cortex area, which people say executive function, planning, et cetera. Are we talking about thoughts? Are we talking about structured thoughts or are we talking about dreamlike thoughts? What in the world is going on in the prefrontal cortex? And here I spend my career in neuroscience and I still can't really understand what it's doing and maybe it's doing 50 things. - Yeah, no, it's a great question. So, you know, to... So one of the studies that we've been working on in addition to the depression work is actually trying to change trait hypnotizability. So David Spiegel and I have been working on this and you know, he's found and published this 10 years ago that a different part of the left dorsolateral is functionally connected with the dorsal anterior cingulate with a lot of functional connectivity in high hypnotizables and not much in low hypnotizables. And that's kind of a different sub-region within this bigger brain region we call left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex than the part that seems to be important for regulating mood. And so the left dorsolateral seems to have connections that are location specific within the overall kind of named brain region that connect to various parts of the cingulate and seem to regulate it. Right? And so if you knock out the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and you have people do the Stroop task, for instance, which is a task where you have, it's a simple task, you probably know this. You have people name the color of words. And so if I look at one of the cards that they'll show you, it'll have the word red in red and that's very easy and that's called a congruent. And then the incongruent is red in the color blue and you have to name, you have to say the word, you don't name the color. - So you have to suppress a response. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so, I'm sorry, you name the color and you see the word written in a different way. And so basically if you stimulate in a way that inhibits the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or either one, you can actually knock out the ability to do that well and it'll take longer for people on the incongruent cards to be able to name it. And so they have a kind of a time delay that's greater than they had before they got stimulated. So that's a part of the prefrontal cortex that's different than the part of the prefrontal cortex that's involved in mood regulation. The nice thing about TMS is that you can go through and you can find these areas that are functionally defined through brain imaging and you can perturb them and answer the question you're talking about. How do I understand this part of the prefrontal cortex and its function, this part? And so we were able to stimulate in an inhibitory way within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that's involved with this sort of cognitive control area. And we were able to knock that area out and increase trait hypnotizability, so people had greater hypnotizability after they got active stimulation versus when they got sham. And so it suggests that that brain circuit is involved in the process of what therapeutic hypnosis ends up being. But it's a very different region within the left dorsolateral than, say, we do when we do these very intensive stimulation approaches to treat severe depression and we're able to get people out of depression. You know, with the part of the dorsolateral that seems to be lower in the, you know, kind of more lateral and inferior on the DLPFC and connected with this subgenual anterior cingulate, so the part of the anterior cingulate that processes emotion. - I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health. And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to AthleticGreens.com/huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Again, that's AthleticGreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3K2. Based on what you told us about the Stroop task and the role of the prefrontal cortex in the Stroop task, to me the Stroop task is a rule switching game. You're saying in one moment, the rule is you read whatever the word says and then you switch and then you say, the rule now is you tell me what color the word is written in and you suppress whatever it is the word says, okay? - [Nolan] That's right. - Okay, a rule in some sense is, like that, is a transiently adopted belief system. So I could imagine that in depression, which has all sorts of backstory to it, that of course the psychiatrist or psychologist or friend can pull on that thread. Like for instance, somebody might believe that they are bad or that they don't deserve love. I'm trying to bring this into the typical language that they would talk about. Or that they will never succeed. Or that even if they keep succeeding, it's just going to get harder and harder and it will never feel good. These are sort of rules like the Stroop task. At some level. There are rules that are more pervasive over time, unfortunately. But I could imagine that if the PFC is also contains some sort of maps or algorithms related to rules of emotionality or self representation or things that we've heard, I think there must be data out there saying that, you know, whatever we heard in middle school when someone made fun of us, we can remember that. 'Cause I can remember things that people said about a jacket I wore one day or something in the fourth grade, crazy, I didn't even like the jacket. Now I think it was kind of cool, but anyway. The point being that we have an intense memory for these things to set up a sort of rule or a question. Like maybe I don't really know how to dress, for instance. Maybe that's why I always wear the same black shirt. But in all seriousness, it seems like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is in this amazing position to access rules which are beliefs and beliefs are rules, and then for moments or longer, to switch those rules. And so for somebody who's depressed to just simply look themselves in the mirror and say, \"You are great, you are fantastic,\" it feels like a lie if you feel like garbage to say that. It doesn't fit with the rule. It's like saying that card is not red, that card is green, when your eyes tell you that it's red. And it seems like there's something about prefrontal cortex that in principle gives flexibility to rules based on what we know about the Stroop task. So given its connectivity, can we assume that the talk therapy that occurs in the psychiatrist office or with a friend or through journaling out something, because we do know that reporting things about trauma or difficult circumstances or the rules that we contain and tend to hide inside of us about how we feel miserable about ourselves or anything really, that in rescripting that, that somehow it allows us to do a sort of Stroop task on our beliefs. Is that a tremendous leap? I'm just really trying to frame this in the context of what I and most people think of as depression. - [Nolan] Yeah, totally. - Because the network components are vitally important, but I guess what I'm trying to figure out is like what are the algorithms that govern prefrontal cortex? - Yeah, absolutely. So in a kind of standard cognitive behavioral therapy session, right, what the therapist is trying to do is identify those beliefs and you know, kind of determine how fixed they are, you know, if they're flexible as you're saying, and then help folks to find another explanation for them and to kind of reintegrate that potential other explanation into their memory system, right? Where I think TMS is really interesting, actually, we had a lot of patients who've told me, like my therapist told me that I wasn't trying hard enough in therapy, and you know, and I really am trying hard, but these are, you know, moderate, pretty severe depressed patients. And as soon as we get them well with the TMS approaches, you know, kind of rapid five day approach and the next week we come in and see them and they'll say, \"You know what I did all weekend is I looked at my therapy books and now I can understand it.\" And so, you know, I actually see TMS as a way of having kind of exogenous sorts of cognitive functions that in milder forms of depression we can pull off with psychotherapy. You know, this idea of being able to kind of turn that prefrontal cortex on and have it govern these deeper regions. In depression, the deeper regions govern the prefrontal cortex. They precede the prefrontal cortex timing-wise. And we've got some data in review now where we're seeing that in depressed individuals that are responsive to our rapid TMS approach, what we call Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, or SNT, or SAINT, if you look at the brain before people get this, they will have a temporal delay where the cingulate is in front of the DLPFC. And in people that are normal healthy controls, no depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is temporally in front of the anterior cingulate. With effective treatment, we can flip the timing of things so the dorsolateral is in front of the anterior cingulate, just like in a normal person. - So you're not talking about obviously physically moving these structures, you're talking about in time, their activation. So in one case, it's like the coach telling the player what to do. And the other is like a player telling the coach what to do. And you restore order to the game. - You restore order to the game. And what it looks like is depression, to your point, is a bunch of kind of spontaneous content that's semi-volitional that's being kind of generated out of this conflict detection system. The cingulate seems to sense conflict and kind of feed that information, gets overactive in depression. And then in depression, it looks like the left dorsolateral does not sufficiently clamp down on it. And what therapy appears to do is to kind of restore that. What we see with TMS over that region is that we just exogenously do the same sort of thing. We restore the governance of the left dorsolateral over the cingulate area, and that is correlated with treatment improvement. So the degree in which you can re-time, re-regulate in time the left dorsolateral over the cingulate, the more of an antidepressant effect you have. - Can we therefore say in crude terms that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex really is the governor of how we interpret physiological signals and spontaneous thoughts? - It places a lens that the rest of the brain sees things through. And you can do these experiments where you can put a normal healthy control person in the scanner and you can make them feel like they have a loss of control and then you can see that region come offline, right? So you can experimentally manipulate the system, and so kind of buffing it up, it's like TMS is almost like exercise for the brain, right? You're kind of exercising this region over and over again with a physiologically relevant signal and kind of turning that system on. And what's interesting, I think really interesting for this show is to, you know, we had a couple of folks, you know, probably five or six folks that have actually told me this, where if they remit early enough in the week, we have this very dense stimulation approach where we can stimulate people really rapidly over a five day block. We don't discriminate when they get better to when they stop. So if they get better on day one, we still give them the other four days because it's in the protocol to do that. And we can't, we're getting to a point where we can tell how long it's going to take, but we're not there yet. And so, you know, every time somebody gets better at day one or two, at the beginning when we first started doing this, we'd say, you know, we're not sure, you know, we think this is safe to keep going, but you know, what do you want to do? And everybody was like, no, I want to keep going. And so, you know, by Wednesday, they're like totally zeroed out on the depression scales, you know, even better than most people walking around. Like really no anxiety, no depression or anything. By Thursday, the first guy that told me this, he came in and he said, \"You know, I was driving back to my hotel and I decided to go to the beach and I just sat there and I was totally present in the present moment for an hour.\" And he's like, \"I read about this in my mindfulness books, but I experienced it last night and I've never experienced anything like this before.\" And I was like, hmm, that's interesting, but kind of wasn't sure. And then I didn't tell obviously any more patients about that, and then about five over the last couple of years, when they remit early in the week, by the end of the week they're like going to the beach and they're like totally having what people describe as a pretty mindful present moment sort of experience, which is really interesting, you know, what that is. I mean, I don't have full on scientific data to tell you, but it's just an interesting anecdote, right? That folks, when you push them through this point of feeling kind of clinically well that some people end up reporting this additional set of features. - You mentioned the cingulate and the anterior cingulate in particular. Because now I feel like for the first time in my career, I have some sense of what prefrontal cortex might actually be doing besides providing a bumper for the rest of the brain. The cingulate, it seems, is a more primitive structure in the sense that ideally it's under the regulation of this top down control from prefrontal cortex, but what's mapped in the cingulate? And for the non neuroscientist out there, when I say mapped, if we were to put someone in a scanner and focus in on cingulate or put an electrode in there, what makes the neurons in there fire? What sorts of things in the body and in the mind and out in the world light up, for lack of a better phrase, the cingulate? What does the cingulate like? - Yeah, yeah, so that Stroop task, those incongruent word color associations, the dorsal part of that. For obsessive compulsive disorder patients, certain kind of triggers. You'll see some of the neural imaging studies will point to anterior cingulate. In the kind of very crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago, the anterior cingulotomy was a way of treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right? 'Cause that area seems to be overactive in people who are experiencing obsessive compulsive disorder. You can kind of walk, the cingulate wraps around, you know, this white matter track like bundles, it wraps around that. And so there's a part that's above that, around that, and below that, and depending upon how much of the conflict task has an emotional component, the more ventral and subgenual that activation is. So the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate seems to be kind of more of a pure cognitive, maybe obsessive compulsive disorder sort of area. Whereas when you start getting into mood sorts of triggers, like facial expression conflicts where you're supposed to, you know, there's an emotional Stroop task where you show the word happy and then you have a face of a person that looks mad, then that's another way of having the same sort of Stroop conflict. That seems to be more perigenual, subgenual areas, right? So you can kind of, you can trigger the cingulate based off the level of emotional valence from none down to a lot. And that seems to be how it's distributed. There are, you know, heart rate kind of components to it and autonomic components in there too. There's something called akinetic mutism, you know, I'm a board certified neuropsychiatrist, behavioral neurologist, and I've seen, you know, a lot of these what we call zebra cases in neurology where people have, you know, these unusual neurological presentations and one of them is akinetic mutism. So if you have a glioma sitting in the inner hemispheric fissure and kind of having pressure on the cingulate, people can get into an almost catatonic looking state where they kind of get stuck and they don't speak. And so that tells you something about how the cingulate works as well, right? It's like if it's not functioning, then people have a hard time kind of connecting with reality. It seems to need to be constantly online to be able to interact with the exterior world. - Is it involved in some of the dissociative states that sometimes people who are very stressed or depressed experience? You said catatonia being an extreme one, but I know someone for instance, that when they get really stressed, and it can even be if someone yells at them or even if someone's angry with them or they perceive someone's angry with them, there's a developmental backstory to why they likely feel this way, they sort of just kind of can't... This is a high functioning individual normally, and they just sort of can't function. They can't complete simple things like email or groceries or things for a short while. It's almost like a catatonia and they refer to it as a dissociative state. Do you see that in depression? And I mean, we're speculating here as to whether or not that involves a cingulate, but what you're saying holds a lot of salience for me in thinking about this example. - Yeah, yeah. There's, so you see catatonia as an extreme outcome of depression and sometimes schizophrenia and other illnesses. Dissociation is an extreme outcome, or even in some cases, a less extreme outcome of PTSD and trauma. And you know, and it's also a phenomenon that happens naturally in some people that are highly hypnotizable. And so if you ask David Spiegel, he'd say that, you know, some of the work that he's been working on is around posterior cingulate in the capacity to disassociate. But yeah, you know, with our stimulation approach to DLPFC, dorsal anterior cingulate, one of the subscales that moved the most was the dissociative subscale for hypnotizability. So even in a normal individual, you know, you see that change in that kind of experience of dissociation. - I am highly hypnotizable. David's hypnotized me a number of times. In fact, we have a clip of that on our Huberman Live clips channel. I've always, well, always. Starting at my early teens, I started exploring hypnosis. I'm extremely hypnotizable. And self hypnosis or assisted hypnosis. I don't know that I ever go into dissociative states. I'll try and avoid forcing you into running a clinical session right now, but to assess anything like that. But this brings about something really interesting, I think, which is I'm aware that some of the more popular emerging treatments for depression include things like ketamine, which is a dissociative anesthetic. Is that right? - Yep. - And my assumption is that as a dissociative anesthetic, that it leads to dissociative states where people can sort of third person themselves and feel somewhat distanced from their emotions. I've also been hearing that there are emerging treatments, psilocybin being one of them, but some other treatments, MDMA, et cetera, that we'll parse each of these in detail, that lead to the exact opposite state during the effect of the drug, which is a highly engaged emotionality and heart rate and sense of self. And can also lead to relief of depression. Now, whether or not this, again, reflects that depression is many conditions as opposed to just one, or whether or not somehow tickling or in some cases pushing really hard on the opposite ends of the scale really matter, I am absolutely fascinated, and again, also perplexed by this. Why would it be that a drug that induces dissociative states and a drug taken separately that induces hyper-associative states would lead to relief of the same condition? - Yeah, no, that's a great question. Yeah, so for ketamine, you know, the level of dissociation appears to be correlated with the therapeutic effect. It appears to be necessary but not sufficient to produce an antidepressant effect. And so folks that don't have any psychological change from the ketamine or don't experience any dissociation typically tend to have less potent antidepressant effects from ketamine. We did a study a couple of years ago, it was really interesting. So we gave folks naltrexone, which is an opiate antagonist, mu and kappa opiate receptor antagonist. And we gave folk, the same individuals, a pill of that or a pill of placebo, and they had no idea which one they were getting. - Was this low dose naltrexone? - [Nolan] 50 milligrams, so it's pretty high dose. - Okay. - Yeah, and so we gave a typical ketamine therapeutic dose, and then we gave 50 milligrams of naltrexone or placebo. And then in the same individuals, we gave two infusions, one with each of those conditions. And if they had an antidepressant effect, we waited until they relapsed and then we gave 'em the other condition. And then we looked to see what effect of blocking the opioid receptor, what effect would you see on the antidepressant effect of blocking the opioid receptor with the idea that if ketamine works the way that a lot of researchers at the time thought that it, you know, completely worked in, which is the glutamate system, then you would have no effect of naltrexone. 'Cause naltrexone just interacts with the opioid system. It doesn't do anything with any other systems. Ketamine has a lot of effects over, you know, it has clear opioid effects in mice in various ways of looking at that, and an MDA receptor antagonism and glutamate effects. And so if it's just that the glutamate part is the part driving the antidepressant effect, you shouldn't have any difference in the antidepressant effect between the two conditions. If, however, the antidepressant effect is primarily is the opioid properties of ketamine are necessary for the antidepressant effect, then you should have a loss of antidepressant effect during the ketamine plus naltrexone condition that you observed in the ketamine plus placebo condition. And what we saw was that there was a dramatic blockade of the antidepressant effect when naltrexone was present. Yeah, in the people that had an antidepressant effect with ketamine plus placebo alone. And then some friends of mine did a TMS study with pain and they stimulated over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and they gave IV naloxone, which works basically the same way as naltrexone, and they were able to block the anti-pain effects of TMS with a opiate blocker. So this idea that another kind of convergent point, right? This idea that the opioid receptor may have a role in mood regulation. What's also interesting is if you look at people that are getting a total knee operation, very painful operation, right? You know, total knee replacement and you age, sex, you know, everything match the individuals that are going through that. But you have a group of people that don't have depression and a group of people that do have depression. The presence of depression triples the oral opioid dose by day four, right? - That's required. - That's required to cover the pain but what may be happening is it's not just treating physical pain, may be treating emotional pain as well, right? At least transiently, it seems to have an antidepressant effect. Chronically, it seems to have a very pro-depressant effect. It can make people treatment resistant. But, you know, it's an interesting phenomenon. But yeah, the opioid system seems to be pretty involved. But what's interesting there with the ketamine trial is that we didn't see any effect on the dissociation. And so the dissociation was the same each time. So the psychological effect of what we call the trip or the kind of dissociative effect where people are having a psychological phenomenon from ketamine, that was identical both times. And so it kind of, it also challenged this idea that the psychological experience of the psychedelic effect may be all that's necessary to produce an effect and that the pharmacology doesn't matter as long as you can achieve that state. And so, you know, we think we pretty clearly debunked that idea that the underlying pharmacology and the state, you know, seem to be important. We don't know for sure if you can, a lot of people are working on this, if you can take out, you know, essentially the psychological effect and still have a drug that works to treat the illness that you're trying to target. And there was a mouse study out this week where they had an LSD analog and they were able to see some animal level data to suggest that could be true. But until we figure that out in humans, it's kind of to be determined. But it is curious, right? Being able to kind of use experimental manipulations to try to separate, you know, some of these phenomenon apart and really understand what's doing what. - It's so critical and it's so critical to the other conversation that we'll surely get to, which is the progression of psychedelics from illicit illegal drugs to clinically validated, and presumably at some point, either decriminalized or legal drugs, which has not yet happened, at least not in the US. But just to make sure that people are getting this and how crucial this is. What we're really talking about here is the fact that, you know, if somebody takes a multi gram dose of psilocybin or somebody takes MDMA or they take ketamine and they experience relief from their trauma, their depression, their addiction, or any number of the other things that indeed those compounds have be shown to be useful for in certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera. There's this like gravitational pull to the idea that, oh, it was the hallucinations. It was the dissociative state. It was the feeling of connectedness. And what we're really saying is that while that certainly could be true, it may be the case that a major source of the positive shift that occurs after the effect of the drug is some underlying biology, like shifts in the mu opioid receptor, a la your experiments with naltrexone, or a change in the underlying neuromodulation that had anywhere from nothing to something to do with the real shift. And I know there's a group up at UC Davis that published a paper in nature about a year ago also looking at this is a chemistry lab essentially, modifying psychedelics to remove the hallucinogenic properties, the mood altering properties, and actually seeing some pretty impressive effects and shifts in mood after the drug wears off. And I know this gets people upset when they hear it. This gets a lot of people upset really. Because people think, oh no, it's the intense experience that matters. But in fact, that may not be the case at all. In fact, it's so powerful for people that sometimes I liken it in my mind to, you know, it's like the birth of a new child and it's such an incredible experience and then people feel so much connection. And then they sort of connect the experience of the actual birth to the connection, when in fact they're, that's true it turns out, but there are a bunch of other things happening too. That's simply the reflection of the fact that you're holding a child and the pheromonal effects et cetera. So anyway, I think it's very important that these different variables be figured out. Along those lines, I want to make sure that before we dive a bit deeper into ketamine and psilocybin, that we do touch on really important topic that has been in the press a lot lately, which is SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 'Cause we can't really have a discussion about depression without talking about SSRIs. And then I want to circle back to ketamine and psilocybin. It seems that there are now data that essentially state that there's no direct link between serotonin levels and depression. Although my understanding is that the SSRIs are powerfully effective for certain forms of obsessive compulsive disorder and may also be effective for treatment of depression, but it may again be through some effect unrelated to serotonin itself. Is that right? And how should we think about SSRIs? Are they useful, are they not useful? What's going on with SSRIs in your patients and in other people as well? - Yeah, so the experiment that I described a bit ago around the naltrexone and ketamine was the first time I'm aware of where we were able to essentially eliminate an antidepressant's effect by using a second drug as a kind of a blockade. And it highlights a bigger issue, right? The issue that we haven't had a good way of really understanding how these drugs work. And so it's the difference. I think a lot of the controversy there is that it's been been difficult, I think, for folks to see that something can on one hand work and on the other hand, we don't know how it works, right? And so SSRIs clearly work. You know, many, many meta analyses kind of proving that out, right? That in a subpopulation of individuals, they achieve great benefit from depression, you know, for depression, for obsessive compulsive disorder, for generalized anxiety disorder, panic, you know, all these things, you can see an improvement in those symptoms with what we call SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The issue there is that these selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors end up blocking the reuptake of serotonin and leaving the serotonin, you know, in this kind of in between, between two neurons for a while and allowing for more serotonin to kind of be there. The issue is that they don't work immediately, right? So they don't work like the same day you start taking them. And that suggests that probably it's not exactly the serotonin being in there that's directly driving it, that it's much more likely that it may have some, say, brain plasticity effects, right? We know that things like brain derived neurotrophic factor get upregulated with chronic oral antidepressant use. And so that's kind of the idea is that these things work, but what's powerful, and I think with the authors of this paper, this extremely controversial paper, were in part trying to say was that there's not a deficit of serotonin. You're not born with what people call a chemical imbalance. And psychiatry's known this. This is not actually new information, anybody, you know, and it's kind of a rehashing of a bunch of information we've known for a while now, but in the lay press, it's kind of hit in a way that it didn't seem to grab attention before with previous publications. But this idea that this chemical imbalance idea is wrong. I really think that part's important because I think that, you know, for a while, I think psychiatry, you know, what I'll call psychiatry 1.0, right? This kind of idea of Freud and psychotherapy and its origins. It was a lot around, you know, your family and those experiences and psychotherapy kind of going in and correcting or helping you to figure out, and you know, you being able to see, or people hear you so that you can eventually come to the conclusion of certain cognitions that aren't helping you, right? And there's a huge importance there, but there's a history where, you know, things like the schizophrenogenic mother and all of that, you know, that was a concept at some point, right? And so we've transitioned from that to, you know, for a long time the chemical imbalance, which I'll call psychiatry 2.0. You know, this idea that there's something chemically missing and I think that the trouble there for a patient who's not a physician, who's not someone who's steeped in these sorts of ideas, who's, you know, more of kind of a person, kind of average American out there, right, is that it's sending a message of there's something missing with me, whether it be my experiences I had no control over when I was a child or a chemical in my brain. What I think is really powerful with TMS, you know, really powerful with TMS, and even powerful with the psychedelic story is it's saying something different. You know, TMS works and there's no serotonin coming in or out of the brain, right? And we're doing a rapid form of TMS that works in one to five days. There's no, it's very unlikely that there's some long term kind of upregulation of serotonin that's driving that. So our work actually kind of pushes back on this serotonin hypothesis as being kind of the center of depression because it says, look, we're not giving anybody any serotonin. We're simply turning these brain regions on and we're focused on the circuitry. And that's psychiatry 3.0. It's not just like neuromodulation. Neuromodulations are really nice, you know, use case for psychiatry 3.0 'cause it's a way to focally and directly perturb brain regions in whatever modality you're using. But you know, there are a lot of groups that are actually doing neuroimaging before and after, and they're able to see circuit level changes for something like psilocybin or ketamine long after the drug is gone, right? Suggesting in those same brain regions converge, so the subgenual default mode network connection that we see is changing with our Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique. It's that same set of brain regions that ketamine and psilocybin seem to act on, act on these connections between brain networks that seem to shift. And so it refocuses the story on something that's highly correctable. And it's basically electrophysiology and it's basically kind of recalibrating a circuit that is recalibrate-able instead of I have something missing or I have some set of experiences early in life that are going to forever trap me in these psychiatric diagnoses. And so it kind of challenges that idea. And I think that's what's so powerful about psychiatry 3.0. This idea of focusing on the circuit because it gets us into thinking about psychiatry and psychiatric illnesses as something that are recoverable. People can get better. People, you know, we've seen with our TMS techniques, we've seen with some of the psychedelic work that we've done where people are actually in normal levels of mood for sustained periods of time or- - Within five days. - Within five or less days. And in the case of the psychedelics, within a few days, right? So we can get people out of these states. They're totally well, there's no drug in their system in that point, in the case of the psychedelics. It was never a drug in their system, in the case of TMS. And it just tells us that it's fixable. It's just like the heart. It's just like an arrhythmia in the heart. It's just like, you know, these other illnesses, that it's like a broken leg. We can go in and do something and we can get somebody better. Then I think what's empowering and what a lot of patients have told me is they say, you know, some people will relapse and need more stimulation or need more psychedelics or whatever it is, but they'll tell me, I've relapsed and I'm depressed again, but I'll never think about killing myself again because I know that if I go get stimulated again, it improves, it gets better. I will be able to reachieve it and I can't. And I don't fear that I'm chronically broken. I don't fear that the chemical imbalance is still imbalanced. I don't fear that these things that I couldn't control in my childhood, you know, are going to be there and drive this problem forever. And I think that's what's so powerful about this. - [Andrew] The sense of control. - The sense of control, the sense of... They're not doing the stimulation themselves. They're not administering the drug in these trials themselves. And they probably never will. These will probably be medical treatments. But they are choosing to do it. And in that sense, they are in control. - Yeah, I have a good friend, I won't out him for reasons that'll become clear in a moment, who was quite obese and lost a lot of weight and was really proud of himself. And then I guess we could say he sort of relapsed in a sense. Not all the way, but far along. But his tone around it was very different. He knew he had accomplished what his goal once before. He was disappointed in himself, but he knew exactly why he had relapsed. It was very clear. He had essentially relapsed to the previous set of eating behaviors and lack of exercise behaviors and has now brought himself back again. And it just resonates with your story that, you know, once somebody understands they can do it because they've been there before, this idea again of considering new rules, that there's... And that brings me to this question about psychedelics and frankly the altered thinking and perception that occurs in high dose psilocybin clinical sessions. It seems that the disordered thinking, even though it could be random, right? Hearing colors and seeing sounds is always the kind of cliche statement of the Timothy Leary area. Also, you know, right there, that's a Stroop task of sorts. It's a synesthesia, it's a combining of perceptions, but it's sort of Stroop task-ish in that it's a new set of rules for the same stuff, right? And many people do report improvements in trauma related symptomology and depression, as I understand it from my read of the clinical trials, after taking psilocybin. Because during those sessions, something comes to mind spontaneously. As you and I were talking about earlier, they will report, for instance, a new way of seeing the old problem. And the old problem could be the voice that they're no good, nothing will ever work out, or could be even more subtle than that. So that raises two questions. One is about the basic functioning of the human brain, which is why do you think the brain would ever hold on to rules that don't serve us well? That's one question. And then the second question is, what is it about psilocybin and related molecules in terms of their neurochemistry, in terms of the ways they disrupt thinking and feeling, et cetera, during the session that allow this novel rule consideration phenomenon? - Yeah. So the first question, I think it's an evolutionary neurobiology answer, right? I think that at the individual person level, you know, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense that when we're really stressed out, some of us want to eat more, right? At the individual person level 'cause it's like, that's not particularly that good for my health in the long term. But if you think about it, like, you know, in some 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, if I'm highly stressed out, it's most likely that I'm about to not have food at some point and I should eat a bunch of food that is high fat, high sugar, high carb food to put on weight for that next phase where in this stress I may be in battle and I don't have food and I have enough fuel on board, right? And so we end up being a result of probably a lot of biology that's not that useful in the modern era. And I think in the brain for, say, let's say PTSD, right? A lot of veterans come back and they experience these PTSD symptoms and they're not at all useful back home, right? You know, they hear some loud noise and all of a sudden they're behind a car or they're behind a, you know, I've heard of folks, you know, jump and run behind a trashcan or whatever in the middle of San Francisco when they hear a loud noise. But if you put them back in the battlefield. - [Andrew] Highly adaptive. - That's highly adaptive, right? And so I think what's interesting is that we, in the absence of using substances like psychedelics, end up having these very persistent memories that are attached to negatively balanced emotion, predominantly, as you were saying earlier, the jacket in elementary school, you know, I had various things like that for me too, right? You remember these things. And we hold onto those things from I think an evolutionary neurobiology standpoint, but what seems to, for whatever reason, kind of alleviate that are these substances, some new like MDMA, some that have been around for thousands of years, like psilocybin, and used as a sacrament in traditions, seem to have a therapeutic effect. It seems to be pretty long lasting for these phenomenon. And so it's just curious, right? It's curious that in the absence of that, these things will keep going on and on, but in the presence of that exposure, then all of a sudden you see a resolution of the problem. And we have some work now we're treating folks with, Navy SEALs, and the data's still being analyzed. But the anecdotes that we're getting, right, are folks are coming back and they're saying it's finally gone, right? These set of PTSD symptoms are finally gone. And so this idea that for whatever reason, going into what's probably a highly plastic state like we were talking about earlier, upregulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor in the case of ibogaine, glial derived neurotrophic factor, this highly plastic state and the ability to kind of re-experience memories. And then as you know, we always reconsolidate a memory when we bring it back up, we always reconsolidate it. But reconsolidating it in that state, for whatever reason, may drive a therapeutic effect. And, you know, the jury's still out. I would say that I'm kind of an agnostic to what tool I'm using kind of guy. Like my business is to find treatments that help people. And so I'm much more like pragmatic about it, you know. If this sort of thing, which has a lot of cultural baggage, but if this sort of thing ultimately ends up being therapeutic, if we can design trials that convince me and others that it is, then we should absolutely use it. You know? And if it doesn't, then we clearly shouldn't use it, right? And I think that's a big question the field's going to have to work out. We have a hard time blinding these trials because the placebo condition is not easy to pull off, obviously. - A placebo for a psilocybin journey is hard to imagine. - We've got, you know, we've been thinking about this and maybe that ketamine study that I was talking about earlier, if we could give people naltrexone and ketamine, maybe that's a good sort of placebo condition, right? 'Cause we know that we can block any of the actual antidepressant effects of ketamine, they still have an experience, you know. And so that's one way of doing it. But thinking about ways to do that and really kind of proving this out. And that's been, yeah, I think that's been kind of central to the way I've been thinking about this. But yeah, I think there's the work that's been done so far, the first psilocybin trial, the first MDMA trial was published in \"Nature Medicine\" recently. - And what do those generally say? I mean, that they are effective for a number of people after one session, two sessions? What's sort of the general contour of? And let's start with psilocybin and MDMA. - Yeah, so MDMA appears to, in one to a few MDMA sessions, have an anti PTSD effect that seems to be, you know, outside of the kind of standard assumed levels of PTSD improvement that you can observe in individuals with this level of PTSD, right? So what we call the effect size, which is essentially like a effect size, the measure that allows for you to compare different treatments to each other for different conditions that are, you know, agnostic to what the actual illness is. You know, the effect size is there, you know, approach effect size is the things that are pretty effective like antacids for heartburn, right? And you see that with MDMA treatment. - So does that mean that for people that have trauma, and again, we're talking about in a clinical setting, they take a one or two doses of MDMA. I think the standard maps dose is 150 to 175 milligrams. Again, doing this with a physician, et cetera, control clinical trial, legal. - [Nolan] Yep, exactly. - They do it once or twice. And broadly speaking, what percentage of people who had trauma report feeling significant relief from their trauma afterward? - It's about 2/3 of people had a clinically significant change in their PTSD. - That's impressive. - [Nolan] Which is impressive, right? - And how long lasting was that? I mean, these trials were ended pretty recently, so... - Yeah, it appears to last for a while. In the earlier trials where they followed people out, it seemed to last for kind of in the years range for some people. And so it's, you know, it's pretty compelling. Psilocybin, you know, and contrast that with ketamine, which only on average lasts about a week and a half for a single infusion, so it's a much shorter. - So they have to get repeated infusions of ketamine every 10 days or so? Forever? - For some people, or they end up getting like a bunch of doses for a couple of weeks. And then for some people that seems to last a while. You know, that's where I think the psilocybin story for depression and the MDMA story for PTSD seemed more interesting to me. - So for psilocybin, what is the rough percentages on, and this would be relief not from trauma, but from depression, correct? - Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it's, you know, in open label studies, it's closer to like half to 2/3 of people end up getting better depending upon their level of treatment resistance. In the blinded trials it was more like 1/3 or so of people, you know, experienced relief. And this is, you know, this is a press release of the data, you know, and so it hasn't, to my knowledge, it hasn't been published yet. And so I'm looking forward to seeing the full paper on that one. But it, you know, separated from placebo and looks pretty good as well. It looks like it's, you know, the first of two trials that need to be done to get this thing approved for treatment resistant depression. And so that stuff looks good. - In terms of MDMA, for many years it was reported in the popular press and there was a paper published in science that MDMA was neurotoxic, that it would kill serotonin neurons. This was what was always said. Then I saw another paper published in science that wasn't a retraction of the previous paper, but rather was a second paper in the same group that essentially admitted that the first time around, they had injected these monkeys with not MDMA, but with methamphetamine, which is known to be neurotoxic. So it was kind of a public admittance of oops or like really big screw up, so oops, but never a retraction and then never really a publicly acknowledged correction in the popular press. So it seems that in the appropriate dosage range, and with these one or two sessions, my assumption, and this again is an assumption, tell me if I'm right or wrong here, is that MDMA is not neurotoxic for serotonergic neurons at appropriate doses and with appropriate sourcing, et cetera. - So it was an interesting study that, I think the guy's name is Halpern, last name's Halpern. - [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern. - Not, different Halpern. I think Joshua Halpern, I'm blanking on his first name, but... - Casey Halpern was a guest on this podcast and is a former colleague of ours at Stanford, who unfortunately we lost to University of Pennsylvania and maybe someday we'll bring him back. - Yeah, that's right. So this individual, you know, received some NIH funding to actually, NIDA, you know, National Institute for Drug Abuse funding to explore individuals of the Mormon faith in Utah who partake in only MDMA. So the way this works is that MDMA happened kind of after a lot of the religious documents were developed. And so MDMA isn't on the prohibited drug list. - The banned substance list. - [Nolan] The banned substance list. - I have some good friends who are LDS. - Yeah, great people. I do as well, you know, just a kind of set of facts, you know. And so these folks only use MDMA but they don't, they're not, you know, the problem with some people using drugs, they're poly substance users, right? So you can't say it's the MDMA if they've also taken other psychedelics and they've taken opiates and they've taken cocaine, and you have this picture where you can't really tease out that problem. But with this, right, it was just individuals that were part of the Mormon faith. And so they were kind of purist in the sense they only used MDMA and he confirmed all of that. And it was a brilliant study, right? Because then he was able to go in and look at their cognitive profiles versus individuals of the same geography, the same faith, all of that, that happened to not take MDMA and found there were no neurocognitive differences. - So does that mean that it was not damaging? - It was not damaging. It's hard to know because to really do this study well, you'd have to track these folks down before they ever took MDMA and do a pre-post and compare to people that didn't. But, you know, this is about as good of a study as you can do, given the situation, to be able to check this out. Additionally, when I was back in Charleston and working in the Medical University of South Carolina, one of my mentors there, Dr. Wagner, was a neuropsychologist at MUSC and he was also the neuropsychologist for the early MDMA trials. And so he did all the neurocognitive batteries for individuals pre-post and similarly did not see any changes in neurocognitive profiles in a negative way. And so, you know, there's data from experimental patients receiving this. There's data from people that are chronic users, you know, who only take MDMA. And that combination of data suggests that there's certainly no apparent risk in the kind of one to two to three dose range. And it's probably unlikely that at least, you know, modest dose exposure over a lifetime doesn't appear to have a profound neurocognitive damaging effect, yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, I know that sourcing is key and we're here, we're talking about clinical trials where purity is assured. And you know, years ago when so-called raves were really popular, maybe they're still popular, never been to one, so wouldn't know if they're happening or not. That's how in the know I am. But it was clear that, you know, testing for purity was important because sometimes the drugs are made such that there are contaminants like methamphetamine, which we know is highly neurotoxic. I think that one reason why people think that MDMA might be neurotoxic is the reported drop in energy or sort of feeling fatigued for a few days afterward. I spoke to a physician colleague of ours who said that that very likely has something to do with the surge in prolactin that arrives subsequent to the big dopamine surge that occurs in MDMA. And I mention that because I know a number of people talk about serotonin depletion after taking MDMA. He has it in mind that while that could be true, it's likely that anytime somebody takes something or does something where there's a huge lift in dopamine, that there's very likely a huge compensatory increase in prolactin that follows and prolactin has a kind of sedative effect, numbing effect on mood and libido, et cetera, that eventually also wears off. Does that make sense to you as a physician? - Yeah, it makes sense. I mean, you know, the difference between, say, MDMA and psilocybin is that MDMA is kind of an amphetamine of sorts, right? So it has effects in dopamine and psilocybin's, you know, pretty neutral, and you know, maybe a little bit of dopamine effects, but kind of much more of a serotonergic focused drug. And so yeah, I think you're going to see kind of a different profile after. And that makes, I haven't heard that story, but that makes sense to me too. - Since you mentioned psilocybin, let's talk a little bit about the neurochemistry of psilocybin. As a serotonergic agent, my understanding is it operates on these, is it the 5HT serotonin 2C receptor? - 2A. - 2A, excuse me. 2A and receptors. And that I've seen a bunch of different reports in terms of what it's actually doing to the brain while people are under the effects of the drug. And this is important for us to segment out because there are the effects that happen while people are under the influence and then the more long lasting effects. But some of the effects I've heard about are, for instance, and tell me again if these are right or wrong, that there is increased activation of lateral connection, sort of broader areas of the brain being coactive than would normally occur. Maybe that explains some of the synesthesias, you know, seeing sounds and hearing colors and that as the trivial example, but rule breaking within the mind. But then I've also heard that perhaps it's lack of gating of sensory input. So normally if I'm looking at something, I'm not thinking about the sensation in my right toe unless it's relevant. But if I'm thinking about the sensation in my right toe, I'm generally not thinking about the truck around the corner. So we have these attentional spotlights, but that somehow it creates a more, it adds spotlights. - Yeah, degates the thalamus. - Degates the thalamus, right, through the particular thalamic structure. So what is the evidence that any of that is true? And are there other phenomena? Is there involvement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that we are aware of? And what I'm really headed here in a few minutes is, you know, is there a place for combining directed stimulation of the brain with psychedelics so that the effects of serotonin could be primarily within the structures that you know from your work to be relevant to depression. So, but to simplify it first, what's going on when one takes psilocybin and why is it interesting in light of depression? - Yeah, definitely. So David Nutt and Robin Carhart-Harris' work around neuroimaging psychedelics are kind of some of the first folks to do that work. And to their great surprise, they thought there was going to be an increase in activity on psychedelics and what they found is the opposite, right? There's kind of an overall decrease in the level of activity in the brain with psychedelics, but they've also looked at connectivity and there's this kind of small world, you know, large world connectivity that you think about. And so, you know, small world meaning there's kind of a much more kind of focused kind of cortical function or, you know, sub-cortical function or whatever it is. And what you see is a difference in that level of engagement of brain regions, the connectivity, kind of global connectivity, to your point, kind of increases. And so, you know, it's interesting, you know, I think to kind of have a conversion theory on this. It's still, you know, to be determined. There's still a lot of work I think that needs to be done. But it's certainly suggestive that there's pretty profound changes in brain activity and brain connectivity after. And what we've found to be really interesting is that the anti-depressant effects of psilocybin have a particular connectivity change that we also see with our TMS approaches, right? And it's this connectivity between the subgenual anterior cingulate and the default mode network. And so when we do this effective Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation, we see a down regulation, the connectivity between them, negatively balanced mood state in the case of depressed individuals and the self-representation of the brain. And you see that same connectivity change occur post-psilocybin, you know, suggesting there's a convergent mechanism and it makes sense, right? You've kind of got an overconnected, negatively balanced system, conflict system that's kind of attached onto the self representation and people feel stuck, right? And then when you do whatever you do that's effective, it unpairs those two systems. - I want to ask you about this phenomenon I've heard about during psilocybin journeys. I heard about this from Dr. Matthew Johnson, who's running a lot of the clinical trials at Johns Hopkins and has been a guest on this podcast. He said that there's something seems to be important about the patient who's depressed or who's under the influence of psilocybin or the patient who's trying to get over smoking or an eating disorder who's taking psilocybin and is in the clinic. That there's something important to this notion of letting go, that people will feel as if their thoughts and their feelings and maybe even their body aren't under their control, and that the clinicians' job under those circumstances is of course to make sure that they're physically safe so they don't jump out a window or try... Actually give an example of a patient who thought that, I think it was a she, could move into the painting in the wall, and obviously that wasn't true in the real world, although it was true in her mind. So they prevented her from doing that. But that letting go, that somehow untethering from the autonomic arousal that's occurring is important. Which brings us back to this idea or me back to this idea of like a seesaw where you're sort of letting go of the hinge and just sort of, your heart rate's going up, like just go with it and trust, you know? Your heart rate's going down, just go with it and trust. You're thinking about something very powerful and depressing related to your childhood, you're just supposed to go there without fear. You're thinking about what's possible in terms of what could happen. So anyway, you get the picture. Can we think of that as just the willingness to do a million different variations on the emotional Stroop task? You know, you'll entertain the full array of rules within your head and consider them. Or is there something more to it? You know, and again, we're in the outer margins of understanding here, but what are your thoughts on this notion of letting go as such a key variable for relief from depression during the psychedelic journey? - Yeah, so I'll talk a little bit about something called exposure and response prevention therapy, that's a typical kind of gold standard treatment for OCD, and I'll help this a little bit conceptually. And so what that really is, it's a letting go therapy. And so, you know, exposure response prevention, the idea is that you have to expose the individual to something that, you know, something that triggers an obsession that they then want to do whatever the compulsion is, right? And so I'll give you, you know, my first exposure and response prevention patient when I was a resident, he was very concerned about leaving the lights on his car. And so what we did is we went out and we turned the lights on in his car and locked his door. So his lights were on, and he was super worried, this is going to kill his battery. And we went and we spent an hour talking about things, and we went back out to his car and his battery was fine, and his lights were on. And he cranked the car and we did it maybe one other time, and then all of a sudden that was gone, right? And that's the idea is that, you know, you're essentially exposing. And you want to do it at levels that are, from an anxiety standpoint, tolerable, but exposing the person to something and then letting them see that that exposure ends up being fine, right? It ends up not causing the thing that they end up being worried about. And so, you know, in some sense, being in the psychedelic state, and we are all taught at a level to retain some level of control. You know, people have more or less of that, but we're all effectively retaining some level of control. We all wake up in the morning and put clothes on to go into society. We all try to say, you know, most people try to say the right things. They don't try to do things that are outside of cultural norms when they're in conversation. And so we're constantly at some level controlling the situation that we're in. And so it's, you know, it's not, it makes a lot of sense that in that state, part of the therapeutic effect that may be linked to the neural circuitry is this idea of letting go and essentially letting the system, you know, the network configuration maybe, whatever it is, assume a state that you've essentially been fighting the whole time. The same way that my OCD patient was fighting this need to click the off button on the lights of his car 50 times before he would go and do whatever he needed to do. And in some level, letting go there, meaning letting us just turn the lights on and him not do anything, or letting go meaning in the psychedelic state, you're just letting go of whatever it is you're holding onto, negatively balanced thoughts about yourself in the setting of having depression or, you know, re-experiencing a trauma memory and allowing that to just happen and seeing it again through a different light. You know, it feels the same in the sense that that's allowing for whatever's going on with these psychedelic states to do whatever they do. - It's fascinating. You said it's exposure response therapy is the traditional name? - [Nolan] Exposure response prevention therapy. - Prevention therapy. Done outside of the psychedelic journey. - It's done outside the psychedelic journey. But that idea of letting go is present in both of those. You know, psychotherapy kind of straight up, totally sober, non psychedelic, non anything psycho manualized, that psychotherapy that we know works really well for OCD. And then, you know, in that psychedelic state, and so people have done studies with psilocybin, and now there's some studies with MDMA trying to look at treating OCD, you know, with this same sort of idea of letting go, right? And how do you have an OCD patient kind of let go? Maybe even letting go of not washing their hands anymore, you know, kind of accepting the idea they're not going to get germs in their hands or whatever it is, you know? And so it's kind of part and parcel, that same sort of thinking. - When I was in college, I developed a compulsive superstition. I'm not afraid to admit this. I somehow developed a knock on wood superstition. And I was actually kind of ashamed of it because it rationally made no sense. I don't consider myself a superstitious person, never was a superstitious kid. You know, I'd step on the sidewalk cracks, I'd walk under ladders, you know, I'd probably even try to walk under a ladder, even though I don't suggest it. But somehow I picked this thing up and I used to sneak it at times. I told my girlfriend at the time that I had it in hopes that that would prevent me from doing it. And it's tricky. Sometimes it actually comes back where I think, gosh, I didn't say, you know, knock on wood, I didn't knock on wood, I hope that doesn't actually happen. And it's quote unquote crazy, right? But crazy in the sense that it makes no sense rationally why the events would be linked. And yet I think a lot of people out there do have internal superstitions. Maybe by talking about it now, it'll go away. Clearly I just need to challenge it. You know, anyway, I mention it because I consider myself, you know, generally rational person, but it's interesting how these motor patterns get activated and this notion of letting go, because I don't actually know what consequence I fear. And the fear, as I was hearing the example you gave, you know, the fear of the car battery running down, I was about to say, \"Well, what if the battery actually did run out?\" Then the therapy would be undermined. And yet that could also be interesting too, because it's not that big of a deal. You jump the car. But in my case, I need to think about what the ultimate fear is. - Yeah, and you know, I think a lot of people, so it's interesting if you look at, say, the OCD scale or the depression scale or whatever, we don't define normal as zero. We define normal as some number range above. So zero to, in the case of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, one of the depression scales we use, 10, right? That's the normal range. And so people could have some sadness and still be considered normal. In the case of the OCD scale, it's about the same 10, right? Where we say it's kind of starts to be, you know, mildly abnormal or something. And I'd always tell the medical students, \"Look, my friends that are surf instructors, they're more like a zero on the Y bar. People that are professionals, you know, they're non-zero, but it's still within the normal range.\" And especially, you know, in the case that you're talking about, it doesn't sound like it got in your way. It doesn't sound, I mean, you're obviously highly successful tenured professor at Stanford and do all the great things that you do. And so it's very much kind of within the normal range, and I think totally assumed that a lot of people have these sorts of things. And as long, I think something as a psychiatric diagnosis when it severely impairs your ability to function and that's when we kind of cross that threshold. But, you know, I think that a lot of people, and it's great that you're bringing this up. I mean, it's very anti-stigmatizing that you're bringing up, right? Because I think a lot of people hold that stuff in and they don't want to talk about it because they're worried that somebody else may think something. But the reality is, as a psychiatrist, I talk to a lot of patients, a lot of people that are, you know, family members, you know, folks that are just going through a death in the family, whatever it is. And what you figure out is like, everybody's got a little something here and there. Everybody has the knock in some way, if that makes sense. And it's just, and we're all just kind of more predisposed not to talk about it. But I think it's important to talk about it because I think that when we start all talking about it, then we realize that we're all kind of in this together in a way. And then some folks that have to knock 100 times, we call that OCD, you know, and they're worried about germs and all these other things. We call that OCD. And then in that circumstance, you know, they need treatment, right? But it is really on, just like blood sugar, just like blood pressure, it's on a range, you know, and it's not just these discreet diagnoses. You have them or you don't. - It's good to know. I actually feel some relief just hearing this, because I am slightly... I wouldn't say ashamed as sort of embarrassed by it, but I offer it as a, you know, it is what it is, as they say. And it certainly doesn't seem to hinder my life much, knock on wood. - [Nolan] [laughs] Nice. - So if we could talk a bit about ibogaine. I don't know much about ibogaine, although anytime I hear the, you know, A-I-N-E, you know, lidocaine, ibogaine, I think of an anesthetic. And going to the dentist, which is an unpleasant experience for me, generally. What is ibogaine? Does this have anything to do with the so-called toad? You know, people talk about smoking frog skin, toad skin. What is it used for clinically? Is it legal in the US as a clinical tool? Who's using it and for what purposes? If you could educate me on ibogaine, I truly know nothing about it, except I think I know how to spell it correctly. - Yeah, that's fair, yeah. So ibogaine is one of the alkaloids that you can extract from a iboga tree root bark that's typically growing in the country of Gabon, Africa. So Gabon is one of the West African countries, kind of middle of Africa and on the west coast. And Gabon has a group of folks, you know, called the Bwiti. It's a religious kind of sacramental group that sacramentally uses iboga root bark as part of the sacrament. And they've been using iboga root bark for a very long time. And it's, you know, part of the tradition. There's a whole set of kind of ceremony around it. If you're interested in this, there's a book called \"Breaking Open the Head\" by Daniel Pinchbeck that goes through and talks about this whole process. But essentially the Gabonese have been using this for a long time and it's a kind of an atypical psychedelic. It's not a psychedelic that we normally think about with psilocybin and LSD where there are visual perceptual changes, right? So if you take psilocybin or LSD, what you experience is you experience these kind of visual perceptual differences in the external world, right? And on enough LSD or psilocybin, an individual can actually perceive something visually in the external world that isn't there, as we talked about earlier. Ibogaine doesn't do that. Ibogaine does something different. It's kind of like, have you ever seen \"Minority Report,\" you know, the movie with Tom Cruise, I think 15 or 20 years ago or something? So it dates us a little bit, but it was this movie where he would be able to go and see these kind of pre crimes. And he had this big screen where he could look at scenes from time and like kind of go through that scene and see it. And so what individuals taking ibogaine will say is that open eyes, they don't see anything, but closed eyes, they'll go back through and re-experience earlier life memories and they will be able to experience it from a place of empathy, not only for themselves, but from others, and kind of detached empathy and being able to see this as almost a third party, even though they were there. But they're able to see it, you know, as a third party. So Claudia Naranjo, a psychiatrist from Argentina, described this for a lot of books that he wrote, in I think the '80s and '90s around this. And so, you know, ibogaine's been around for a long time. Howard Lotsof, American guy that brought it over from Africa. He was a polysubstance user, used every drug that he could get his hands on, took ibogaine, and including a lot of other psychedelics, by the way, took ibogaine and then never did another drug again, supposedly because he had such a profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine is in no way a recreational substance. It's not a recreational substance if you want it to be a recreational substance, because you're essentially having this, what they call life review. They also call it 10 years of psychotherapy in a night. So these are the terminology that people talk about the issue. - How long does it last? Is it truly one night? - It's usually, you know, it can go, depending upon if you get re-dosed or anything, go sometimes, depending upon how fast you metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours. Sometimes it can be shorter, but it is a long time. It's a very long time. So it's definitely the longest acting psychedelic substance I know of. And so people, you will take this, and they'll have this reevaluation of a given memory. And then as we were talking about earlier, reconsolidate that memory again, and then it seems to have, you know, an effect of that reconsolidation process. And so, you know, about five, four, five years ago, I was tapped by Robert Malenka, one of the senior neuroscientists we both know in the university. And he says, \"Well, there's an unnamed donor that's very interested in funding a scientific, kind of open label study of these Navy SEALs that have been going down to Mexico and taking ibogaine and also 5-MeO-DMT,\" which I'll talk about in a second, to treat PTSD. You know, they claim to have traumatic brain injury, depression, you know, that whole constellation of symptoms. You know, and as it was described to me by various people that had done this, by their spouses and and whatnot, you know, John, we'll just say John, John couldn't screw a light bulb into a light fixture, right? They were just so debilitated they couldn't do simple tasks, what we call activities of daily living. And they were coming back and having these really dramatic improvements in all aspects of life. And so, you know, we have over the last couple of years been able to do this first in human, kind of full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation of what ibogaine is doing. In this case, in special operations, special forces individuals, former Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, that kind of crew of folks, and look at the pre-post changes that their experience to be able to totally quantitate all of that. And so we've been able to capture all the clinical scales, you know, depression scales, PTSD scales, all that standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. So how does your executive function work specifically? How does your verbal memory, all of that? And then neuroimaging and EEG. So this will be the first human study of ibogaine for those. And the reason why is because ibogaine is kind of the... Both seemingly the most potent and most seemingly, to me at least, most powerful psychedelic, but the one that has the most risk too, because it has a cardiac effect. It seems to be that you can screen people out that have risk off of their electrocardiogram and reduce the risk quite a bit. And that's what we all did. But that's why people haven't really studied it as much. And it isn't as, in addition, nobody goes to a rave on ibogaine. There's no recreation at all with this. - It's not fun. - It's, people say that it's relieving, but it's hard work, right? Because yeah, you're reexamining things. And you know, and so then we see these folks after, and I'll tell you, you know, we haven't fully analyzed the data yet, but I'll tell you that, you know, from what my folks are telling me, it's pretty dramatic. You know, people come back and they're doing a lot better. They're doing a lot better. And nobody, I'll knock on wood, nobody's had any sort of cardiac issue at all in the cohort that we've studied and they look a lot better and they feel a lot better too. And they describe these experiences of being able to go back through and, you know, soldiers experienced something called moral injury, right? Where maybe they accidentally blew something up and had a kid in it or something like that. You know, if they're in Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, you know, a child died on accident or maybe a civilian died or whatever it was, right? And they suffer these moral injuries as part of the job. And it's almost one of the kind of vocational risks. They come back and say that they've forgiven themselves, you know, which is huge, right? And part of that is being able to see themselves in a different light and having empathy finally for themselves and being able to kind of have that experience of forgiving. And so, very cool. The study, you know, what was happening was they were taking ibogaine and then taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call it the Toad, it's the Sonoran River Toad. I think it's like you can find these in Mexico, find 'em in Arizona. In the back of the toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT, which is a flavor of DMT that produces a particular psychedelic effect also used as a sacrament. - Is it dimethyltryptamine? - It is a 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. So it's a kind of a dimethyltryptamine with a kind of addition to it. The deal there is that it lasts longer than traditional DMT. You know, it's like 20 minutes to five, three, or whatever kind of thing. And so these guys were taking ibogaine and then they would take the 5-MeO-DMT after. We had to kind of divorce those two things to be able to do the study and just understand what the ibogaine was doing. And they'd go back down a month later and they'll do the 5-MeO-DMT. - So two completely separate sessions. - [Nolan] Two completely separate sessions. - And then one quick question about ibogaine before a bit more on 5-MeO-DMT. Is the ibogaine journey guided, or the person just closes their eyes and they just start falling into the back catalog of memories? - They have a bunch of preparatory sessions, and then they have a bunch of sessions after that they're able to kind of rehash things. During, there's a sitter that sits there and kind of sits with them and helps them out, but it's not, it's pretty, the phenomenon of the drug seems to drive a lot of this, right? And so a lot of it ends up being what we call supportive psychotherapy. You're just kind of being there and, you know, maybe you're holding the person's hand, maybe you're just saying \"I'm here,\" or maybe whatever it is, but you're making sure they know you're around. But there's not really an interaction per se. And then the whole kind of goal there is just to get folks to kind go back through and reexamine these memories and ultimately look like they reconsolidate them. And you know, it's very interesting. I mean, there's this kind of, as you said earlier, Timothy Leary kind of sociocultural construct that ends up being overlaid over psychedelics. And what I think is that if you rid yourself of all of those preconceived notions of what it is and isn't, and the counterculture movement, all that stuff that neither of us were ever involved in, neither of us are ever partake in, you know, as kind of straight scientists looking at this, right? If you can kind of rid yourself of all those sociocultural constructions and then reexamine this, if we just discovered these today, we would say that these sorts of drugs are a huge breakthrough in psychiatry because they allow for us to do a lot of the sorts of things we've been thinking about with SSRIs, with psychotherapy, but kind of combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs in a substance that kind of allows you to reexamine these things. And so it's interesting. There's a lot to do to try to figure out if that's true, you know? And I can say that as it stands right now, we don't know if that statement is true, right? There's a lot more work that needs to happen for that statement to be proven to be true. But the hypothesis is, if it is true, then it's very likely that this will be seen as a breakthrough because it allows you to do these sorts of things that you can't do with normal waking consciousness. But also why we have to really think about this. And, you know, these drugs can't be recreational drugs. They really shouldn't be recreational drugs, right? They're really too powerful to be used in the context of recreation because they can put you into these states. And this generation of psychedelic researchers are really clear about that. You know, I think the '60s folks were not clear about that, and they felt like there was this whole kind of cultural thing that was going on there. But I think this cohort of individuals really understands that in order to really make this happen, we have to understand that if you need a prescription for an SSRI, which doesn't change your consciousness a whole lot, and we're very worried about that, and the doctor has to evaluate you for that every week, that the idea that some of these substances would go outside of very strict medical supervision is kind of preposterous actually. It's kind of a dumb moment, I think, for all of medicine to say, look, if we're going to do this right, we've got to do it such a way that's so protected, that's so safe, that we make sure people know these things are not recreational and they're really for the pure purposes of really powerfully changing cognition for a while and letting people have these what seem to be, you know, relatively therapeutic states. - I think it's great that you're doing this study. And along the lines of the sort of the early iterations of psychedelics and the counterculture of the '60s and '70s, some of which took place, like \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" I think is actually based on the Menlo Park VA, which is in our neighborhood of Stanford. And things are quite a bit different now. I know you and I have spent some time with the operators and former operators at an event, and last Veterans Day, in fact, the so-called Veteran Solutions group that's pioneering a lot of these psychedelic treatments for former special operators and current special operators. And what's interesting to me about that is in contrast to the counterculture movement of the '60s and '70s, that room was filled with people that are very much of a structure, the military. Right? So it's no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-military, pro-military. Here this isn't just about one group of people who's exploring psychedelics as a treatment for trauma and PTSD and other things. And of course you also have other domains of society looking at this. And in fact, there were, but it was really interesting because there were both far left and far right politicians at that event up on stage together, talking about, in kind of lighter terms, heart medicine, but also talking about neurobiology and talking. It was just fascinating from the perspective of somebody who's trying to learn about this stuff, that psychedelic therapies no longer sit within the anti-establishment realm. It's independent of all that, certainly when people in the military are adopting it as a potential treatment. Again, still under exploration, but also under exploration at universities like Stanford and Johns Hopkins and UCSF and University College London and on and on. Along the lines of tree barks and toad skins, tell me about ayahuasca. And as a plant, you know, it's intriguing. And is it pro-serotonergic drug like psilocybin? And is it useful for the same sorts of conditions that we've talked about thus far? And if you could perhaps tell me a little bit also about the Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca is another psychedelic. It's used as a sacrament in Brazil and in Peru and Ecuador, in Columbia. So a lot of the South American countries. And what they do is they combine two plants together, where one plant of the two plant combination would effectively do nothing, but the two plant combination together is capable of producing this very profound psychedelic effect. And what's really kind of curious is that there are, as I understand it, 10 to 20,000 plant species in the Amazon. And somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined these two plants together in certain proportionality and cooked this for five, 10 hours to the point where you cook out the dimethyltryptamine out of one of the plants and cook out the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor out of the other plant in such a way that the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents the GI breakdown of the dimethyltryptamine in such a way that it's then allowed to cross the blood-brain barrier and get into the brain. And if you didn't add the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant derived into this combination, then it would never cross the brain. If you put people on a standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor that wasn't reversible, you'd throw them into serotonin syndrome, right? So this kind of like sweet spot that somehow ayahuasca practitioners have found of being able to get DMT into the brain from an oral source with this combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is curious. And so that substance has been explored as an antidepressant agent, and some studies have looked at that. It also seems to be very safe. There's a psychiatrist down at UCLA Harbor who's done a lot of work with this, where he's looked at children even that have been exposed to kind of small doses of ayahuasca as kind of a sacrament within Amazonian tribes and found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects in adults. And so it appears to be safe. It's kind of part and brought into various religions, including kind of merged with Catholicism in South America, which is kind of very interesting. And so, you know, in some sects of Catholicism in Brazil, it's used as a sacrament during religious ceremonies. And so it became interesting to Brazilian researchers as to whether or not they could affect recidivism rates for prisoners in Brazilian prisons, right? So they gave half of the prisoners, you know, some sort of inert substance and half of the prisoners an ayahuasca session. And the recidivism rate or the return to prison rate in the ayahuasca exposed individuals was statistically significantly lower than the recidivism rate in the control group, suggesting that, you know, whatever is going on there seems to have an effect on whatever drives criminal behavior, whatever criminal behavior that happened to be. And I don't have the details on the exact nature of the crime. You know, I am also in no way saying that we should just be giving psychedelics to folks in prison and all of that. I think that that is a very edgy thing to do and probably not something that anybody should try, but it does kind of bring up this curious question of what is it about that that would drive people to change those behaviors and why do people make those behavioral decisions? And a lot of times if you look at prisons in the United States, you know, people say this, what's the biggest mental health facility in the United States? It's a prison. - Yeah, there's a lot to unpack there for sure. You know, the homeless issue, the prison issue. It does lead to something that I heard recently, which is related to all this, which is cannabis. You know, we hear a lot nowadays about people will say, well, it's safer than alcohol. And we did an episode on alcohol that, at least by my read of the literature, indeed alcohol does seem to be quite bad for our health beyond... I think it's pretty clear that not drinking is better for your health than drinking at all. And here, I'm not trying to tell people what to do, but those are what the data say. And forget the studies on red wine. You'd have to drink so much red wine to get enough resveratrol. It's not even clear resveratrol does anything useful anyway, et cetera, et cetera. Nonetheless, cannabis is now available in a lot of very high potency forms. People are vaping cannabis, people are smoking cannabis. I certainly am not saying that cannabis is bad for people necessarily, although I think children, I would hope that their brain development would be completed first, you know, get to age 25. I know that sounds late for a lot of people, but the THC obviously taps into some endogenous systems and the cannabinoid systems and is powerful. And I've seen this report that was in Lancet Psychiatry this last year that said that early use of potent cannabis, meaning age 14 to 20 or so, can potentially lead to an exacerbation of psychosis later in life. And I actually put this out on social media and it sort of exploded. I didn't expect it to. And people were saying, well, that's not causal. And obviously it's not causal because people say, well, maybe people with psychotic tendencies are seeking out cannabis. Although that's sort of a weak argument in the sense that there's at least a 4X increase in these psychotic episodes for people later in life. But what are your thoughts about cannabis? Because I do want to acknowledge that it does have medical benefits for certain things, pain, chemotherapy. So by no means trying to knock on cannabis and its appropriate medicinal use. But what should we think about cannabis in terms of this finding that it can exacerbate a psychosis in certain individuals? - Yeah, so I think, you know, there's a couple of things, right? So cannabis is multiple cannibinoids, right? - Right, THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and, you know, indicas, it gets, yeah, there's a lot there to unpack. - Yeah, there's a lot. But there are two main kind of chemicals you think about and kind of how things are essentially bred, right? And so, you know, there's a lot of cannabis that's really bred to be very high, very potent THC. And there's cannabis where the THC's bred completely out. So there's stories, you know, from Colorado, right? This strain of cannabis that's THC free, there's no THC at all, and it's all CBD, and it's called Charlotte's Web. And a bunch of kids' parents, one kid, and then kind of a string of parents after that moved to Colorado when cannabis was legalized, because CBD is antiepileptic, so CBD is also antipsychotic. And so there have been a number of studies that if you give CBD at high doses, it's antipsychotic in established schizophrenic patients. The issue is that we've bred CBD out of marijuana selectively over time. We've gotten very good at figuring out how to do that, right? Conversely, THC is pro psychotic and pro epileptic, right? And so when you talk about does cannabis cause psychosis or does cannabis treat psychosis, it appears to be more related to the proportions of CBD to THC than it does to the kind of idea of cannabis. So for me, and I have no stock in this or anything like that, but there's a company called GW Pharmaceuticals, and I haven't looked into them in a while, but they have a lot of clinical trials for something called Dravet Syndrome, which is a seizure disorder where kids seize a whole lot, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which is a seizure disorder, kids are seizing 300 times a day. Both of these are like kids are seizing so much, they're basically in a seizure or in the postictal phase constantly. And they've failed everything. They've failed barbiturates, they've failed bromides, which we just don't use anymore except in these cases because of the side effects. And they'll give kids CBD. And I think CBD is a pretty safe drug compared to bromide, right? And so this idea that CBD in a kid is actually safe, it's a cannabinoid, but it's CBD and it's safe, right? And so that to me is totally fine. Also giving CBD as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia. There have been some positive trials and negative trials in that, but there seems to be no negative side effects. It seems to reduce some of the metabolic syndrome issues in folks with schizophrenia who are having side effects from the primary antipsychotic. The converse is, there's clearly cases where people that are taking very high doses of THC become psychotic, they get put into the psychiatric unit, nothing happens other than they kind of get the THC out of their system, and then they resolve their psychosis, right? And so that, and you know, a handful of people who have had seizures related to high doses of THC and syncope and all sorts of things. And so this idea that THC, high doses of THC can be pro psychotic, is also not taking a shot at people that think that cannabis overall is a good thing. It's just, it just is what it is. And the kind of pure, I think if you zoom back and you say you're a true naturalist, you're thinking about natural medicines in the world, you should think, well, probably marijuana was balanced THC CBD at some point, and then we humans messed with it, right? And that most likely, that was probably okay at some level, and then we pushed it one way or another. And what I mean by okay is in a 45 year old, it's okay, kind of thing. Now, what I think is going on with the kids, with the teenagers, is you've got prefrontal maturation, right? And then you're exposing them to a whole lot of high THC load. And while it's unclear if it's cause or effect, it's certainly in the picture. And if I were a parent, I wouldn't want my 16 year old smoking marijuana. If I were a parent and my 30 year old, otherwise healthy, totally fine, you know, whatever, banker, lawyer kid decided to try marijuana for the first time, I wouldn't scold them about it, right? So I think it's this kind of a different thing, right? I would never want my up to 25 year old, just like you're saying, before prefrontal maturation, I would never want my kid to be exposed at all. But it looks like, except in susceptible individuals that are susceptible to drug-induced psychosis, it looks like, you know, it's a relatively safe thing past prefrontal maturation. You know, again, I'm not going to comment of cause and effect, but I would say that, you know, if you're a parent, it doesn't make much sense, right? You never know what's ultimately going to hurt your kid. I mean, we were talking about this earlier, my wife's pregnant now. She kind of avoids everything, right? Rightfully so, right? This idea that we just, we want to be careful when our children's brains are developing. And I think that's really what you were saying and I think actually important. The bigger question that you asked, which is relative risks of drugs, is an interesting one. So David Nutt published in, I think it was in \"The Lancet,\" I'll have to look it up, but I think in \"The Lancet,\" an article about relative drug risks for the person and for society. And this was like, he was on the UK's like British Drug Policy Group, where essentially what he showed was if you look at societal risk plus personal risk, and you combine those two, you know what drug is the most dangerous drug in the world? - I'm going to guess it's alcohol. - It's alcohol, right behind heroin and cocaine and da da da da da, and somewhere in the middle is marijuana. And right on the tail end, on the exact other end of this, psilocybin. - Is caffeine, usually doesn't make the list. - It may have been on the list. If it was, it was probably pretty close to psilocybin, but somewhere in the middle was ketamine, somewhere in the middle was amphetamine, somewhere in the, you know, a little closer to psilocybin, I think was MDMA, you know. But it's this combined personal kind of world risk of these things. And so alcohol makes it, because there's a huge amount of personal risk and there's a huge amount of societal risk, right? Drunk drivers kill X amount of people in the world. - Fight, sexual assault, all that. - All that, yeah. And then all the cancer and all that stuff. And so it beats out cocaine, it beats out heroin, it beats out all of these things. And yet, we don't, as a culture, for whatever reason, we don't as a culture see it as a drug. And that's the part that really baffles me, you know? - I mean, they serve it. I mean, this is no knock on Stanford at all. Of course, I wouldn't do that. This is at every institution I've been to, they serve alcohol at the graduate student events. - [Nolan] That's right. - You know, they serve alcohol. They do a happy hour. I've never been a drinker. I can take it or leave it. - [Nolan] Yeah, same. - And I realize that some people, they really enjoy alcohol. You know, my former partner, I mean, she just was in that 10% or so of people who have a glass of wine and just feel great. And the second one, feel great. I just want to take a nap after I have a bit of alcohol, so it never does much for me. I always feel poisoned. I feel lucky in that sense. But it's unbelievable that it is so prevalent and it's just, it's baked into the medical, even medical institutions, they'll pop a bottle of champagne to celebrate the opening of a hospital. - [Nolan] That's right, that's right. - You know, that's pretty crazy. - Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. You know, I think what's going to happen, but this is me, you know, looking at the crystal ball a little bit, but I think what's going to happen is what happened with doctors and smoking. So if you look at the '50s and '60s, right? There are all these pictures of doctors smoking cigarettes, you know, with patients or, you know, psychiatrists doing psychotherapy and smoking a cigarette with the patient sitting on the couch, you know, surgeons smoking a cigarette in between cases, there are all these pictures of that, right? And now all of a sudden, smoking's totally banned. I think it's totally banned from most of Stanford campus. My suspicion is, as you're suggesting, right? You know, this is everywhere and it's all kind of ubiquitous. At some critical point, some tipping point, everybody's going to realize that, just like with smoking, we've got to rid hospital systems and universities of alcohol. And at some point in 50 years, it's my view that we'll look it back at these scenarios that you're talking about and be like, you know what, we were foolish about this. I can't believe that we gave people alcohol when they graduated from whatever, you know? And I think we'll have a different take on it, but it's going to take a longer time. I think people did a really good job tying smoking to lung cancer and it's like a very simplistic story. Smoking, lung cancer, you know? Now, as you know, alcohol increases the risk of a lot of different cancers. Not so clear which one. I mean, there's like, you know, the kind of oral, like the throat, tongue cancer, that's one of- - Breast cancer. - Yeah, breast cancer, you know? And so it's kind of just, it's a harder story to tell, you know? And I think that's why, and everybody, you know, and then there's this whole, it's, you know, my mom says this. It's like I drank my glass of wine because my doctor told me it was heart healthy. And we were talking about this, and I try to, no, no, no, but Dr. So-and-so said it's heart healthy. And so it ends up being this thing where like she's drinking alcohol because she thinks that it's good for her heart. And, you know, and it's hard. I've had those conversations with her. It's hard to untie that. And I think that, yeah, at some point we're going to hit some threshold moment. And it'll be interesting if we really look at the data and we really look at what's safe and not safe purely from this analysis, it kind of points to the right direction. - It's really interesting. And also say nothing of poor judgment under the influence of alcohol. I mean, I would venture that if we were to remove alcohol from university campuses, watch, the students are going to lobby against me if I say this. But if you were to remove alcohol from campuses, I mean, just think about what I suspect would be the improvement in good decision making. And that would occur. Or, you know, I've got stories from graduate school and... It was very different, you know, 10 years ago. There was a lot more alcohol consumption. Again, that was never my thing, but I know people who make really bad decisions. In any case, there's a whole landscape there emerging. I think you got your finger right on the pulse of it. I want to touch on something slightly different than what we've been talking about, but definitely related to depression. And this, again, is one of these intriguing but perplexing things, which is that sleep deprivation can improve symptoms of depression. And yet I'm personally very familiar with the fact that if I don't sleep well for one night or don't sleep at all, in fact, I do have an ability to function pretty well the next day. I'll do this non-sleep deep rest practice that I blab a lot about on the Huberman Lab Podcast, which for me is tremendously restorative, but I like a good night's sleep. I think everybody understands now, thanks to the great work of Matthew Walker and others that have really gotten out into the world saying, look, the foundation of mental health, physical health, and high performance, if that's your thing, being a functional human being, is to try and get enough quality deep sleep at least 80% of the nights of your life, if you can. That's something to focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise and social connection, et cetera. So sleep deprivation, we know, in particular, I think rapid eye movement components of sleep deprivation can improve the symptoms of depression. And yet being sleep deprived can also really disregulate our control of the autonomic system. I notice on night two or night three of poor sleep, if I'm going through a stressful phase and that's happening, all of a sudden my heart rate is chronically elevated, my thought patterns become really disrupted. I can't then exercise, my decision making is thrown off, my emotionality is more labile. The hinge, as we were referring to it earlier, feels less in control, under my control. And maybe I wonder sometimes if I enter that state that you refer to earlier, where the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is no longer leading the cingulate, but the cingulate is now in charge. The players are in charge of the coach. Not a good situation. So I know you've done some work on sleep deprivation and light and effects. Please tell us about that and please tell us about this triple therapy. Is that? - Yeah, yeah. So friend of mine, Greg Salem, another one of the professors at Stanford, was very interested in sleep. He did a bunch of training in sleep before he went to medical school and got very interested in this idea that, as you're saying, if you sleep deprive somebody one night in just kind of an isolated single night, at the end of that sleep deprivation, they will have an antidepressant effect, but as soon as they fall asleep, they lose it. So if it's a depressed individual, you can get them to be less depressed acutely. Soon as they fall asleep, they wake up eight hours later, then they come back into the same level of depression. And so the idea is that you needed to do some sort of circadian reset. And that part of what depression is, is that it's a dysregulated circadian system. And so mentors of mine say, if you can just get the sleep better, that's half the battle of dealing with depression. 'Cause so many people have insomnia around depression and have a whole host of types of insomnia. Having a hard time falling asleep, waking up in the middle of the night, and waking up earlier, all symptoms of depression. And so what this does is it sleep deprives the individual and then there's a certain calculation of shifting their phase and simultaneously exposing them to bright lights. So that's the triple, the phase shift, the sleep deprivation, and the bright light, to try to get their circadian rhythm. Essentially the theory is reintrained. And so, you know, in the trials that we've done and other trials prior to ours and after, you know, it looked like there was a pretty profound antidepressant effect from this triple therapy that seemed to be durable, meaning durability is this term we use to say that not only can you get kind of point relief, but that the relief ends up, you know, lasting. What's important to know about this is like, you shouldn't do this at home for sure. You would need to do this with a professional, 'cause it's complicated, it's not just one thing. And sleep deprivation, while it seems to be antidepressant, it's pro anxiety. So if you take a highly anxious person that's not depressed and you sleep deprive them, they get profoundly anxious. And so that's the other thing that you have to really realize is that this is like everything else that I've talked about today, all things that you have to do under medical supervision, but curious, right? And I think, you know, the question that always comes up is why isn't this used more? And I think the reason is that there's not really a mechanism for, you know, ultimately in medicine, as sad as it is, you have to have a code to do a thing. There has to be a code associated with a treatment and it's hard to figure out how to make a code for this. And so I think that's part of it. And so if there's a way, and somebody's got to kind of take that baton on that, but if there's a way to make a code for this, you know, I think you could actually turn it into something that was more widely utilized. And, you know, probably dream up ways of how to integrate AI, passive sensing, all that stuff to really make that work. But I think that would be the idea, that would be the trajectory I'd see, so, yeah. - Yeah, having a billable to insurance code is fundamental. And a lot of listeners to this podcast, I think, have a background in engineering science. And we will put a link to that manuscript that talks about the triple therapy, because here we're talking about one night sleep deprivation, some timed light exposure to the eyes, and then shifting in the circadian clock being central to the themes of the podcast that come up often. I think for the typical person, can we say that trying to get a regular light dark cycle at sleep rhythm would be beneficial for overall mood regulation? - Yeah, I think for the typical person, you know, really kind of reregulating your sleep and trying to get, you know, a good night's sleep in which you fall asleep, stay asleep, wake up at a set time every morning is going to be pretty crucial. You know, in mild depression, I think that one has a lot of control over that. As we were talking about earlier, I think when you hit some threshold in depression where things become kind of semi-volitional and it's harder to kind of will yourself into that. There are therapies like, you know, there's a CBT for insomnia, for instance, where you can do cognitive behavioral therapy to help with insomnia. Sometimes people, and I'm no sleep expert. Kind of pass this to Greg to fully talk about this, but some of what goes on that people with kind of milder insomnia experience is like blue light out of their computer and things like that, so you can use like blue light blockers to, it tricks your brain, as you know better than me, it tricks your brain to think that it's still light outside. And so people will still have insomnia because their brain still thinks that it's light outside. And then people will, you know, the kind of strict CBT for sleep. You know, therapists will say there are only two things that you should do in your bed. And if you're under a certain age and whatnot, it's really one thing that you should do in your bed, which is to sleep and be with your partner, right? And so those are kind of the two things that you should do in a bedroom. And that's really the only things that you should do in a bedroom if you're having sleep problems. You shouldn't watch TV in a bedroom, you shouldn't eat in a bedroom, shouldn't hang out. - Keep the phone out of the bedroom. - [Nolan] Keep the phone out of the bedroom, yeah. - Yeah. We should get Greg Salem on the podcast. I'll just mention for people that want to regulate their sleep, we have a sleep toolkit that's available as a downloadable PDF at hubermanlab.com. Just go to the menu and a lot of the things in that toolkit are based on work from Stanford Sleep Laboratories, including Jamie Zeitz and others' lab, not aimed at depression specifically. Listen, Nolan, Dr. Williams, this has been an amazing voyage through the circuitry of autonomic control. This landscape of the prefrontal cortex is, I find incredibly fascinating and I just want to start off by saying please do come back again and teach us more about that and your TMS work. Before we wrap, however, I do want to give you the opportunity to talk about the SAINT study. - [Nolan] Yeah, definitely. - Is it SAINT or SAINTS plural? - Yeah, it's SAINT. So SAINT, or we're calling it SNT now. SAINT has, you know... The intent was not to kind of connect it to religion, but we may have accidentally done so. And so we abbreviated it to SNT for the subsequent trials, which was initially Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, or now what we're calling Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy. But the idea there, which is a cool idea, is that TMS is a device that delivers a treatment, and the treatment is the protocol. And the protocol is the stimulation parameter set in a specific brain region for a specific condition. And so what's cool about neuromodulation, whether it be transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation or deep brain stimulation, like what Casey Halpern talked about on another podcast, is this idea that in all of those cases, the device itself is a physical layer conduit of a stimulation protocol that's therapeutic for a given condition in a given brain region. And so in the case of depression, which we know the most about for with TMS, we've been doing TMS studies for depression for, you know, since 1995, right? And the clearance in 2000, 2008, 2009. And in that timeframe, we were able to go from really knowing very little at all about how to do something like this to getting an FDA clearance. And the way that it went down was that there were two groups studying different components at NIH. The first group was studying mood neuroanatomy on functional imaging. That was kind of the first generation of functional imaging back then, so PET scans, which are kind of metabolic scans, and then SPECT scans. And the idea there was looking at activity and metabolism and prefrontal cortex. And what they found in these kind of more crude scans is that just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism. The other group right upstairs at the National Institute for Neurological Diseases and Stroke, NINDS, they were looking at using TMS, which had been around for 10 years, and repetitively stimulating in motor cortex. And what they found was, gosh, we can get a readout in thumb muscle movement amplitude that's really reproducible across people. It's like, you know, universally reproducible. And if we do certain stimulation approaches, they are biologically active to either increase excitability, IE the thumb motion, and a set intensity goes up, the amount of amplitude goes up, or inhibitory or depotentiating, it goes down with other biological stimulation approaches. And then a third outcome, which is important, that it's inert, it doesn't do either. So you can have stimulation approaches that do one, you know, increase activity, decrease activity, or are inert. And so what they found was, oh, we can excite certain brain regions. Then my mentor, Mark George said, had this kind of aha moment where he said, \"Wow, there's underactivity in prefrontal cortex in depression, and we can increase activity using this thing that we know we can increase activity in motor cortex. We just need to put it in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\" And then they combined the two and started stimulating once a day in this kind of very abbreviated fashion. And lo and behold, some of those depression patients resolved their depression. And back then, and still today, you can go and as a psychiatric patient stay at the National Institute of Mental Health and go through clinical trials to try to get treated. And there were patients who'd been there for months and they were able to be discharged. Because their mood was better, yeah. And so just very crude approach where they were using ruler measurements where DLPFC was, and they were stimulating with devices that you needed to physically dunk the coil in an ice bath. And with that, they still were able to, the kind of genius of this, Mark and others, they would still be able to create a purely engineered stimulation approach. What's cool about that is that they kind of found two things, right? They found this one stimulation protocol that does have some antidepressant effect. It's limited, it doesn't treat everybody, it does have some antidepressant effect. And this bigger concept that a neuromodulation device is kind of like a pharmaceutical company for you, right? That in a given individual, a TMS device or whatever neuromodulation device is able to generate, you can create a stimulation approach that is specific to a given condition and specific to an individual. And so the physical layer is just how you exert that, similarly to how we make pharmaceutical drugs in a pharmaceutical company. But the actual therapy itself is what you do, where you do it. And so what we learned from, you know, another 20, 30 years of this is that you can modify the stimulation protocol in such a way where you can create a whole new treatment and put it through the same TMS device or, thank god, an evolved version of it where you don't have to dunk it in ice baths and they can actually really handle much more aggressive stimulation approaches. And so in 2005, a group published in \"Neuron\" a paper demonstrating that if you stimulate with the hippocampal rhythms through a TMS coil, you can excite the brain with memory rhythms and it'll last an hour. So you can change cortical excitability in the thumb twitch for an hour, sending three minutes of excitatory or 40 seconds in the case of inhibitory stimulation that mimics hippocampal rhythms. So much more efficient than the original TMS approaches. And so, you know, after that group tried to do it in this kind of six week schedule, and after that, you know, and while they were doing that, we decided, gosh, you know, this problem I talked about at the beginning of the show where you have this problem that we don't have a treatment for people who are in these high acuity psychiatric emergency states, right? This idea that we are going to engineer a treatment where we can reorganize the stimulation approach in time to be much more efficient by utilizing something called space learning theory. And so you probably know about the space learning theory. So the idea for the viewers is, it's a simple psychological thing, but we've also seen it in hippocampal slice sort of physiology too, where if I'm cramming for a test, what I do is I write out 60 note cards and I read each one for a minute until I get to the first note card and again, and that's about an hour later, right? And we just intuitively do this. We all, you know, automatically do that. And we intuit that because we know that what doesn't work is writing out one note card and looking at it over and over again. Nobody ever does that, right? You know, we've all been in graduate school, medical school, and we have these big stacks of note cards. That's space learning theory. It's this idea that you need to see it about every hour to an hour and a half and that optimizes learning. If you take the same stimulation approach that I'm talking about, this data burst stimulation approach, and you take a hippocampal slice of a mouse and you stimulate, you enlarge some dendritic spines and you prime some. And then if you stimulate right after that, you don't get any change. It's called in mass stimulation. But if you wait about an hour to an hour and a half, you get more dendritic spines enlarged and more primed. Which, by the way, also is what ketamine does, it causes a dendritic spine enlargement. And so, you know, what we found was is that the old way of doing TMS, this idea of just doing it once a day, every day, five days a week for six weeks, didn't utilize the space learning theory. It's like studying for a month or two, just a little bit once a day. Like you remember some of that stuff, but it's like not as potent as that week where you're kind of cramming, right? And what we realized is that if we could reorganize the stimulation in time so that we took the whole six week course, we actually figured out a way to do it in a day. And then what we also figured out is that people were underdosing TMS because if you just keep going after six weeks out to month three, four, five, more and more people got better. So we figured out it's not just one day, we're going to give five times the normal dose. We're going to have 7 1/2 months' worth in five days using space learning theory. - So every hour? - [Nolan] Every hour for 10 hours. - For five days. - For five days. So it's a 50 hour block. It's 90 minutes of actual stimulation, but spread out through the day in the same way of learning. Which is perfect for an inpatient psychiatric unit, right? - [Andrew] Five days is manageable. - Yeah, you can get stimulation. Nobody's ever dropped out by the schedule. You know, folks that want to do this, want to do it. So they'll do their nine minutes, they'll go get breakfast, they'll do their nine minutes, they'll go see their therapist or whatever it is. And so what we found with this reorganization and time of the stimulation dose, and then the third component is we do resting state functional connectivity scans on everybody. And we have ways now in the last five to 10 years of picking out that specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit that I was talking about earlier, that cingulate DLPFC, we can pick that out in every single one. If you want to come to the lab, we can find your DLPFC subgenual. It's even more robust than non- - Maybe we could stimulate too, just while we're in there. - Yeah, if you want to, we can move around your hypnotizability. And we can find that spot in each person. Instead of finding the same spot on the skull, we find the same spot on the brain, and we can stimulate. And we do that every hour on the hour. And what we've found is that folks will, within one to five days, you know, in more cases than not, and depending upon if you're looking at this open label or in trials, somewhere between 60 and 90% of the time, they will go into full on remission in the sense they're totally normal from a mood standpoint at the end of this. And like I said, with variable durability. So that's the part we have to figure out now about dosing and how to keep people well. But for some people, you know, we've had four years of remission, you know, year of remission. And it's really that cramming of the test. It's really that idea that you're laying in that information to the exact right spot. And the signal is a simple signal, but it's a profound one, which is turn on, stay on, remember to stay on. You know, that idea that you're sending this memory signal into the brain and you're doing it in such a way that you're telling the system, you're kind of taking it out of your own hippocampus' hand and you're sending the same signal the hippocampus normally signals out. Now you're sending that signal into the prefrontal cortex and kind of utilizing the brain's own communication style to get it to get out of the state. And what's very cool about this is that people, when they kind of exit out of that, they end up saying they don't have any side effects from it. And they feel back to normal. Like some people, you know, not everybody, but there's a subsection of people that with SSRIs where they'll say, I kind of feel numb, or I have GI side effects, or I can't, you know, I don't have the sexual interest that I used to have and that sort of thing. You know, not anything against SSRIs, as I said earlier, life saving, you know, for a subsection of people, these things really work. But with this, what you see is that people don't talk about any of that stuff. And I think it's likely because you're tapping into that core circuitry and you're reversing it and you're doing it with a magnet that, because it's a very profound electromagnet, it's the same field strength as an MRI scanner, it's able to induce a current in the brain in this focal targeted way without getting into the rest of the brain, without getting into the rest of the body at all. And just really kind of acting only on that circuitry that's involved. - Incredible. Is the SAINT study still ongoing? And if people are interested in potentially being patients or subjects in the study, can we provide them a portal link? - Absolutely, yeah. So we have, now the treatment, some of my students went over to a company called Magnus Medical, and they've been working on this, they've got an FDA clearance now. And now folks can get it through trials over the next couple of years because it's going to take some time for that company to kind of get up and running and get a device and get the whole thing set up nationally. But while that's all going on, there's still about 1,000 patients that need to be recruited across a bunch of different trials all over the country. We'll take people from anywhere in the country. We also have partners in New York and San Diego and in soon to be South Carolina and other places where we can actually kind of, you know, my lab can help to kind of let people know where to go, based off of where they're at in the US, and get them access to being able to be in a trial. And what we've tried to do is make it so that even if you get the, you know, 50 50 chance, you're going to get the real deal or you're going to get the non-real deal. But what we have figured out is a way to let everyone have access. If they got the not real deal version, the kind of sham version or the fake version, for the first part of the trial, there are other trials where they can have access to the real version. So essentially everybody eventually gets access to having the real version. And so that's been a big thing for me is I want everybody that comes through one of our trials to be able to have access. I think it's important. While the company's doing what they're doing and what the lab's doing, and kind of nationally what other partner labs are doing. - Well, I can assure you, you're going to get some interest. - [Nolan] Happy to have it, yeah. - Thank you. And listen, thank you so much for taking us on this incredible voyage through the neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects of depression, the coverage of the different types of depression, the various therapeutic compounds, how they work. We've talked about a lot of things today. You've shared so much knowledge, and even as I say that, I very much want to have you back to talk about many other things as well that we didn't have time to cover, but also just really want to thank you for the work that you do. I know we are colleagues, but you run an enormous laboratory, enormous in my book. 40 people is a big group, very big group. Plus you're in the clinic, you also have a life of your own outside of work. And to take the time to sit down with us and share all this knowledge that really is in service to mental health and human feeling better and in fact avoiding often suicidal depression. It's just incredible work and incredible generosity. And just thank you so much. - Oh, thank you, man. I mean, you know, similarly I want to thank you for what you're doing. I mean, I think that what you, you know, I've got a lot of friends, folks that are not in the medical profession, friends of mine, you know, one of my buddies who's a real estate agent who works with us, who's a big, big fan of your show. And you know, I told a couple people like that I was coming on and they were like super stoked. They're like, you know, we watch every show and, you know, super excited to watch mine. And they said something very important to me that, you know, you make this complicated neuroscience and kind of brain-body science accessible, you know, in a way that few have a gift to do. And I think that that's so important and this show is doing so much to help with science literacy. And yeah, appreciate you, so... - Well, thank you. I'm gratified and honored by your statement and I look forward to more. Thank you. - Absolutely, thank you. - Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Dr. Nolan Williams. I hope you found our discussion about psychedelics and other compounds, about transcranial magnetic stimulation, and about the treatments for depression in general, to be as stimulating as I did. If you'd like to learn more about the work being done in Dr. Williams' laboratory, you can go to the Brain Stimulation Laboratory website, which is bsl.stanford.edu. And there you have the opportunity to apply to be in one of the clinical trials for depression or other studies, as well, if you like, to support the work being done in Dr. Williams' laboratory for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders.

    "rawText": "- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [bright upbeat music] - I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we continue our discussion of the senses. And the senses we are going to discuss are pain and pleasure. Pain and pleasure reflect two opposite ends of a continuum, a continuum that involves detection of things in our skin and the perception, the understanding of what those events are. Our skin is our largest sensory organ and our largest organ indeed. It is much larger than any of the other organs in our body. And it's an odd organ if you think about it, it has so many functions. It acts as a barrier between our organs and the outside world, it harbors neurons nerve cells that allow us to detect things like light touch, or temperature or pressure of various kinds. And it's an organ that we hang ornaments on. People put earrings in their ears. People decorate their skin with tattoos and inks and other things. And it's an organ that allows us to experience either great pain or great pleasure. So it's a multifaceted organ and it's one that our brain needs to make sense of in a multifaceted way. So today we're going to discuss all that. And most importantly, how you can experience more pleasure and less pain by understanding these pathways. We will also discuss things you can do, and if you wish things you can take that will allow you to experience more pleasure and less pain in response to a variety of different experiences. Before I go any further, I want to highlight a particularly exciting area of science that relates to the skin and to sensing of pleasure and pain, but has everything to do with motivation. Motivation is something that many people struggle with, not everybody, but most people experience dips and peaks in their motivation even if they really want something. How should we think about these changes in motivation? What do they reflect? Well at a very basic level, they reflect fluctuations changes in the levels of a chemical called dopamine. Most of us have heard of dopamine. Dopamine is a neuromodulator meaning it modulates or changes the way that neurons nerve cells work. Most of us have heard that dopamine is the molecule of pleasure. However, that is incorrect. Dopamine is a molecule of motivation and anticipation. To illustrate how dopamine works, I want to highlight some very important work largely carried out by the laboratory of a guy named Wolfram Schultz. The Schultz Laboratory has done dozens of excellent experiments on the dopamine system and have identified something called reward prediction error. Although in some sense you can think about it as reward prediction variance. Changes in the levels of dopamine depending on whether or not you expect a reward and whether or not you get the reward. So I'm going to make this very simple. Dopamine is released into the brain and body and generally makes us feel activated and motivated, as if we have energy to pursue a goal. And it is released into the brain and body in anticipation of a reward. Measurements of dopamine have been made in animals and humans. And what you find is that when we anticipate a reward, dopamine is released, we will put in the work to achieve that reward. That work could be mental work or physical work, but when the reward arrives, dopamine levels drop back down to baseline. That's right. When we receive a reward, dopamine levels go back down to baseline. So the way to envision this as you can just imagine a sort of increase in dopamine as we anticipate something we're working towards it, we're working towards a goal. We're excited about seeing somebody or meeting somebody or receiving some reward and then the reward comes and dopamine goes down. Now that's all fine and good, but there is a way to get much more dopamine out of that process and therefore a way to have much more motivation, energy, and focus because those are the consequences of elevated dopamine. The way to do that is to not deliver the reward on an expected schedule. So experiments have been done where there's an anticipation of a reward, there's work, and then the reward only arrives every other or every third about of work, okay? So this would be like getting a pat on the head. If you're a dog or a, perhaps a child or an adult, or getting a monetary reward only for every third project or every third race that you win. Pick any kind of goal. It doesn't matter. These molecules don't care about what you're pursuing. They are a common currency of different types of activities. That's a regular reward schedule, and it will not alter the pattern of dopamine release that I described before. However, if the reward arrives intermittently almost randomly, so you anticipate a reward as a maybe it might come, it might come. Then you work, work, work, work, work, no reward. You repeat the work, work, work, work, work, work, and then you get a reward. So some trials, you do some trials, you don't, and it's completely random. Under those conditions, the amplitude, the amount of dopamine that's released into your system and the motivation to continue working hard or playing whatever kind of game you're playing, doubles or triples. And this is the basis of things like slot machines and gambling. And this is why so many people will give so much of their money up to casinos and the casinos always win. Sometimes people walk away with more money than they came to the casino with, but the vast majority of the time, the house wins as they say. And it's because they understand intermittent reward schedules. And you can apply this to stay motivated in your own pursuits. Rather than thinking about the pleasure of a reward, understand that dopamine is released in response to anticipation reward, and that is the fuel for work. And every once in awhile at random remove the reward. That's the way to continue to stay motivated. Not to reward every action or every goal. And this is also true, if you're trying to train up children or train up players on a team, you should not celebrate every win. I know that's a little counter-intuitive, we're going to go more into the biology of dopamine and how it relates to the pleasure system later on in the podcast, but for now understand intermittent reward schedules harness the biology of dopamine in ways that can allow you essentially infinite motivation over time. Before I go any further, I want to acknowledge that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many, if not all of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. And nowadays with the advent of DNA tests, you can get further knowledge into the mechanisms that are going on in your body and how those mechanisms are changing as they relate to metabolism and hormones and other aspects that profoundly impact your wellbeing. The problem with most blood tests, however, is that you get information back and it will tell you whether or not your levels of something are higher, low, or within range, but it doesn't give you any directives. It doesn't tell you what to do with that information. With InsideTracker has this wonderful feature. It's a very easy to use dashboard that has suggestions about lifestyle factors, exercise, nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, that one could take in order to adjust those numbers according to your personal goals. So the whole thing is made very easy. In fact, they can come to your home to do the blood test and DNA test if you like. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do that you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code huberman@checkout. And I should also mention that through August 15th, 2021, you can get a free inner age test. That's a measure of your biological age according to your DNA and other factors with any purchase from InsideTracker store. So go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans and up to up and through August 15th, you can get a free inner age test. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix makes mattresses and pillows that are ideally suited to your sleep needs. Everybody's different. Some people sleep on their sides, some people sleep on their stomach, some people sleep on their back, some people run warm during the night, some people run cold. If you go to the Helix's website, helixsleep.com, you can take a quick two-minute quiz, and then it will tell you what your ideal mattress is. It will match you to your ideal mattress. I did this and I matched to the so-called Dusk mattress. I like a mattress that's not too firm nor too soft. I tend to run hot during the night and I tend to sleep on my side or on my stomach. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress about nine months ago, and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress to one that's ideally suited to your sleep needs, go to helixsleep.com/huberman, take their two-minutes sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress. And you'll get up to $200 off that mattress order, and two free pillows. They have a 10-year warranty and you get to try out the mattress for a 100 nights risk-free, they'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it, but I think you really will love it. So again, if you're interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started drinking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started drinking Athletic Greens and the reason why I still drink it once or even twice a day is because it takes care of all my foundational nutritional needs. It includes vitamins, minerals, and probiotics which are important for the gut microbiome, this colony of bacteria, healthy bacteria that we all have living in our guts. And when that bacteria is healthy, our brain functions better, our immune system functions better. There is now a lot of research to support that. Athletic Greens taste delicious. I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice. And as I mentioned, I drink it once or twice a day, usually in the morning and again in the afternoon. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and claim a special offer. That special offer is a year supply of vitamin D3K2. There's now a robust literature showing that vitamin D3 is critical for various aspects of our health, metabolic health, endocrine health, et cetera. And you'll also get five free travel packs. When you travel mixing up Athletic Greens is made really easy by these little travel packs. You just put them in a jar or other a water bottle, mix it with water. It's very easy to do on a plane or in the et cetera. Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3K2. So let's talk about pleasure and pain. I think we all intuitively understand what pleasure and pain are. Pleasure generally is a sensation in the body and in the mind that leads us to pursue more of whatever is bringing about that sensation. And pain is also a sensation in the body and in the mind that in general leads us to want to withdraw or move away from some activity or interaction. That's not always the case. Some people actively seek out pain. Some people somehow can't seem to engage with or experience pleasure, but most people operate on this basis of pleasure and pain. Scientists would call this appetitive behaviors, meaning behaviors that lead us to create an appetite for more of those behaviors and aversive behaviors, behaviors that make us want to move away from something. The simplest example of that would be putting your hand near a hot flame, at some point, there would be a reflex or a deep desire to withdraw your hand. Tasting something delicious in general makes us want to eat more of that thing. Interactions with other people that we find delicious, also make us want to interact with those people more. None of this is complicated or sophisticated. This is simply to illustrate the fact that pleasure and pain tend to evoke opposite responses, opposite behavioral responses and opposite emotional responses. So how does that come about? Well, it really comes about by an interaction that starts at one end of our body, meaning our skin and the other end of the organs of our body, which is deep within the brain. So let's consider these two ends of the spectrum of pleasure and pain and what they contribute to those experiences of pleasure and pain. The organ that we call the skin, as I mentioned earlier, is the largest organ in our body. And throughout that organ, we have neurons, little nerve cells. Now to be really technical about it, and the way I'd like you to understand it is that the so-called cell body meaning the location of a cell in which the DNA and other goodies the kind of central factory of the cell, that actually sits right outside your spinal cord. So all up and down your spinal cord on either side are these little blobs of neurons, little collections of neurons. They have a name if you'd like to know for you aficionado or those who are curious, they're called DRGs dorsal root ganglia. A ganglion is just a collection or clump of cells. And those DRGs are really interesting because they send one branch that we call an axon, a little wire out to our skin, also to our muscles into our organs, but here we're talking about the skin. They send a wire out to our skin and that wire literally reaches up into the skin. It's actually in our skin and they have another wire from that same cell body that goes in the opposite direction, which is up to our brain and creates connections within our brain in the so-called brainstem. What this means is that the neuron in your body that we call the DRG that sends a wire an axon to sense what's going on in your big toe and then sends another axon in the opposite direction into the base of your brain, that is the largest cell in your entire body of any kind. Fat cell, muscle cell, nerve cell, et cetera. Is extremely long cells. It can be a meter or more depending on how tall you happen to be. So we have these cells that have wires they go off in two different directions and the wire that's within our skin will respond to any number of different categories of stimuli. These wires are positioned within the skin to respond to mechanical forces. So maybe light touch, some will only send electrical activity up toward the brain in response to light touch. Meaning if you press on the skin really hard, they don't respond. You stroke the skin lightly with your fingertips or a feather and they respond very robustly. Others respond to course pressure, the hard pressure, but they won't respond to a light feather, for instance. Others respond to temperature. So they will respond to the presence of heat or the presence of cold or changes in heat and cold. And still others respond to other types of stimuli, like certain chemicals on our skin. Many of you have probably experienced the sensation of eating a hot pepper. Well, I don't recommend doing this, but were you to take a little slice of jalapeno or other hot pepper, habanero pepper or something like that and rub it on your skin, you would actually feel something at that location. And that's because that pepper doesn't just create a sensation within your mouth, it will create a similar sensation on your skin. So these neurons are amazing. They're collecting information of particular kinds from the skin throughout the entire body and sending that information up toward the brain. And what's really incredible, I just want you to ponder this for a second. What's really incredible is that the language that those neurons use is exactly the same. The neuron that responds to light touch sends electrical signals up toward the brain, the neurons that respond to cold or to heat or to habanero pepper, they only respond to the particular thing that evokes the electrical response. I should say that they only respond to the particular stimulus, the pepper, the cold, the heat, et cetera, that will evoke an electrical signal, but the electrical signals are a common language that all neurons use. And yet, if something cold is presented to your skin, like an ice cube, even if you don't see that ice cube, if your eyes are closed, or someone comes up behind you and puts an ice cube against your bare skin back, you know that that sensation, that thing is cold. You don't misperceive it as heat or as a habanero pepper. So that's amazing. What that means is that there must be another element in the equation of what creates pleasure or pain. And that element is your brain. Your brain takes these electrical signals and interprets them. Partially based on experience, but also there are some innate meaning some hard wired aspects of pain and pleasure sensing that require no experience whatsoever. A child doesn't have to fall down but once to know on that first fall, that hurt. They don't have to touch a flame, but once and the very first time they will withdraw their hand from the flame. So no prior experiences required. Other things prior experience is required. For instance, if you're somebody that has an intense, intense aversion to spicy foods, that's probably because you've tasted spicy foods before. Likewise, if you really like sweet foods, it's probably because you've tasted them before. So you can start to make predictions based on prior experience, but the pain and pleasure system don't need prior experience. What they need is a brain that can interpret these electrical signals that can take these electrical signals and somehow create what we call pleasure and pain out of them. So what parts of the brain? Well, mainly it's the so-called somatosensory cortex. The portion of our neocortex, which is on the outside of our brain, that kind of bumpy part, not kind of if you have a normally formed brain, it will be bumpy. If you have a smooth brain that's not good. Some animals just have a smooth brain. Humans have a bumpy brain, which means it has a very large surface area. And those bumps are 'cause you squeezed it like a pizza and clump and you bunched it all up and put inside the skull. That's good. That means you have a lot of neurons. And in your somatosensory cortex, you have a map of your entire body surface. That map is called a homunculus. And if we were to take your cortex and lay it out on a table, I've actually done this with the cortices of various animals and humans included. What you would find is that there's literally a map of your entire body surface. But it wouldn't look exactly like you, this map would be very distorted. Why would it be distorted? Well, certain areas of your body have a much denser innervation as we call it, or put simply many more of these sensory wires from these DRGs within your skin. So this map of you that exists in your brain, and you do have one of these on each side of your brain, so you have two of these maps to homunculi, that is you, it's your representation of touch including pleasure and pain. And in that map, your lips are enormous. And your back is very, very small. And the area around your eyes and the area representing your face is absolutely enormous. So you would look like some sort of odd, weird clay doll from some sort of bizarre late night animation thing. And just imagine the psychedelic experience of that character of you and that's what it would look like. But it's not randomly organized. To the contrary, it's highly organized in a very particular way, which is that the areas of your skin that have the highest density of the sensory receptors are magnified in your brain. So it's sort of like having more pixels in a certain part of a camera than others, and in doing that allowing higher resolution in this case of touch, not a vision, but of touch sensation in certain parts of your body. What are the areas that are magnified? Well, the lips, the face, the tips of the fingers, the feet, and the genitals. And so this map of you has very large lips, face, tips of fingers, bottoms of feet, and genitals. And that's because the innervation, the number of wires that go into those regions of your body far exceeds the number of wires for sensation of touch that go to other areas of your body. You can actually experience this in real time right now by doing a simple experiment that we call two-point discrimination. Two-points discrimination is your ability to know whether or not two points of pressure are far apart, near each other, or you actually could perceive incorrectly as one point of pressure. You might want a second person to do this experiment. Here's how you would do it. You will close your eyes, that person would take two fine points. Don't make them too sharp, please. So it could be two pencils or pens or the backs of pens. Two pens I'm holding in my hands. If you're just listening to this, I'm just holding two pens. My favorite pens, these pilot, V5 or V7, which I love. If you were to close your eyes and I were to take these two pens and put their points close together about a centimeter apart and present them to the top of your hand, I'm going to just going to do that now to myself. You, even though your eyes were closed, you would be able to perceive that that was two points of pressure presented simultaneously to the top of your hand. However, if I were to do this to the middle of your back, you would not experience them as two points of pressure. You would experience them as one single point of pressure. In other words, your two point discrimination is better, is higher on areas of your body which have many, many more sensory receptors. You are more sensitive at those locations. Now this makes perfect sense once you experience it or you hear about it. However, most of us don't really appreciate how important and what a profound influence this change in density of receptors across our body surface has. And we can go a step further and describe another feature of the way that you're built and the way that you experience pleasure and pain, which is called the dermatome. The dermatome is literally the way in which your body surface is carved up into different territories. Much like a map of the United States is carved up into different territories of states and counties, et cetera. The dermatome is the way in which neurons connect to different parts of your body. Now, you've actually experienced the dermatome before. The dermatome is when you have a neuron that connects to a particular area of the body and that neuron doesn't just send one little wire out like one little line and go up into the skin to detect mechanical, or thermal, or chemical stimuli. It actually sends many branches out like a tree. But remember those branches of the tree come from one single neuron. Now, occasionally what will happen is you will experience something like cold, or heat, or pain, or tingling on a patch of your body. And occasionally that patch of body will actually have a very cleanly demarcated boundary, a very stark boundary with the areas around it. A good example of this would be the herpes simplex 1 virus, which if one has this virus, and I should mention that somewhere between 80 and 90% of people have this virus, this is not a sexually transmitted virus. This is a virus is transmitted very easily between people through various forms of contact non-sexual contact, it's present in children, it's present in adults and most people get it, some get symptoms and some don't some get recurring symptoms, some don't. We can talk about that at the end, if you like, but this virus lives on what's called the fifth cranial nerve also called the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve sends branches out to the lips, to the eyes, and to certain portions of the face. So for those of you listening, I've just kind of put my right hand across my face and to sort of simulate the three branches, the trigeminal aspect of this nerve. So tri three. Now, when the herpes virus flares up, as they say, in response to stress or other factors, the virus inflames that nerve and people experience tingling and pain on the nerve. Sometimes they'll get a cold sore or a blister on their lip or near their mouth, sometimes they'll get a collection of those. And that's because that dermatome is actually inflamed. Now other people will experience something like shingles. It's a fairly common viral infection. And what they'll notice is they'll get a rash that has a boundary. It's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps, sometimes blisters, and it'll have a sharp boundary. That boundary exists because the virus exists on the nerve. And so it actually is boundaried with the neighboring area of the body that's receiving input from another nerve and that one doesn't have the virus living on it. So anytime you see a rash or a pattern on the body surface on the skin that has a pretty stark boundary, chances are that's an event that's impacting the dermatome. I've experienced this before then not through herpes simplex, but through the experience of having a lot of blood sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment across the front of my face, it was really bizarre. I looked in the mirror and I thought, what is going on here? I was having an allergic reaction to something I'd eaten. And that allergic reaction clearly was affecting one of the nerves and therefore the dermatome and what it showed up was, it was almost like someone had drawn lines on my face that said, okay, this rash or this reaction rather can happen here, but not in a region right next to it. Whenever you see that chances are it's a reaction of the nerves of the dermatome. So you'll start to see these things more and more when you start to look for them. You don't always have to have a viral infection to experience this. Sometimes you'll just experience tingling or even a pleasant sensation, and it will be restricted in kind of a strict boundary on one location or your body surface and not another. Not corresponding to an organ like, okay, this arm or just your feet or something like that. But just a segment. It's almost like someone outlined a particular area of her body surface. That's the dermatome. So you've got sensors in the skin and you've got a brain that's going to interpret what's going on with those sensors. In fact, we can take an example of a sudden rash or inflammation at one location, the dermatome, and we can ask what would make it hurt? What would make it worse? What would make it go away? And believe it or not, your subjective interpretation of what's happening has a profound influence on your experience of pleasure or pain. There are several things that can impact these experiences, but the main categories are expectation. So sort of whether or not you thought or could expect that this thing was going to happen, right? If someone tells you this is going to hurt, I'm going to give you an injection right here, it might hurt for a second. That's very different and your experience of that pain will be very different than if it happened suddenly out of the blue. There's also anxiety, how anxious, or how high or low your level of arousal, autonomic arousal, that's going to impact your experience of pleasure or pain. How well you slept and where you are in the so-called circadian or 24-hour cycle. Our ability to tolerate pain changes dramatically across the 24-hour cycle. And as you can imagine is during the daylight waking hours that we are better able to tolerate, we are more resilient to pain, and we are better able to experience pleasure. At night our threshold for pain is much lower. In other words, the amount of mechanical or chemical or thermal meaning temperature stimulated that can evoke a pain response and how we rate that response is much lower at night. And in particular, in the hours between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM, if you're on a kind of standard circadian schedule. And then the last one is our genes. Pain threshold and how long a pain response lasts is in part dictated by our genes. And later I'm going to discuss this myth or whether or not it's really a myth as to whether or not certain people in particular red heads, people who have reg pigmented hair and fair skin, whether or not their pain thresholds differ. And to just give you a little sneak peek into that, indeed they do and it's because of a genetic difference in a particular gene, in a particular pattern of receptors in the skin that are related to the pigmentation of hair and skin. So we have expectation, anxiety, how well we've slept, where we are in the so-called 24-hour circadian time and our genes. So let's talk about expectation and anxiety because those two factors can powerfully modulate our experience of both pleasure and pain in ways that will allow us to dial up pleasure if we like and to dial down pain, if indeed that's what we want to do. So let's talk about expectation and anxiety because those two things are somewhat tethered. There are now a number of solid experiments, both in animal models and in humans that point to the fact that if we know a painful stimulus is coming, that we can better prepare for it mentally and therefore buffer or reduce the pain response. However, the timing in which that anticipation occurs is vital for this to happen. And if that timing isn't quite right, it actually can make the experience of pain far worse. So here I'm summarizing a large amount of literature, but essentially if subjects are warned that a painful stimulus is coming, their subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced. However, if they are warned just two seconds before that pain arrives, it does not help. It actually makes it worse. And the reason is they can't do anything mentally to prepare for it in that brief two second window. Similarly, if they are warned about pain that's coming two minutes before a painful stimulus is coming electric shock or a poke or cold stimulus or heat stimulus that's pretty extreme, that also makes it worse because their expectation ramps up the autonomic arousal. The level of alertness is all funneled toward that negative experience that's coming. So how soon before a painful stimulus should we know about it if the goal is to reduce our level of pain? And the answer is somewhere between 20 seconds and 40 seconds is about right. Now, I'm averaging across a number of different studies, but if you have about 20 seconds or 40 seconds advance warning that something bad is coming, you can prepare yourself for that, but the preparation itself and the arousal that comes with it, the kind of leaning in, okay, I'm either going to relax myself or I'm going to really kind of dig my heels in and kind of meet the pain head on. That seems to be the optimal window. This can come and useful in a variety of contexts, but I think it's important because what it illustrates is that it absolutely cannot be just the pattern of signals that are arriving from the skin, from these DRGs, these neurons that connect to skin that dictates our experience of pain or pleasure. There has to be a subjective interpretation component, and indeed that's the case. So let's talk about the range of pain experiences. And from that, we will understand better what the range of pleasure experiences are that different people have because we are all different in terms of our pain threshold. First of all, what is pain threshold? Pain threshold has two dimensions. The first dimension is the amount of mechanical or chemical or thermal stimulation that it takes for you or me or somebody else to say, I can't take that anymore. I'm done. But there's another element as well which is how long the pain persists. I'll just describe myself for example, I don't consider myself somebody who has a particularly high pain threshold. I don't think it's particularly low either, but I wouldn't consider myself somebody that has a particularly high pain threshold. When I stubbed my toe against the corner of the bed, it absolutely hurts. But one thing that I've noticed is that I have very sharp inflections, very high inflections in my perception of pain, and then they go away quickly. I don't know if that's adaptive or not. It's probably not, but my experience of pain is very intense, but very brief. Other people experience pain in a much kind of slower rising, but longer-lasting manner. And to just really point out how varied we all are in terms of our experience of pain, let's look to an experiment. There been experiments done at Stanford School of Medicine and elsewhere, which involved having subjects put their hand into a very cold vat of water and measuring the amount of time that they kept their hand in that water. And then they would tell the experimenter very quietly, how painful that particular stimulus was on a scale of one to 10 so-called Likert scale for your aficionados. That simple experiment revealed that people experience the same thermal in this case, cold stimulus, vastly different. Some people would rate it as a 10 out of 10 extreme pain. Other people would rate it as barely painful at all, like a one. Other people, a three other people, a five, et cetera. Now what's interesting is that the same thing is true for experience of a hot, painful stimulus 120 degree hot plate, where you have to put your hand on it, and then at some point you remove your hand. Some people are able to keep their hand on there the whole time, but people rate that experience as very painful, a little bit painful or moderately painful depending on who they are. Now, that's interesting, probably not that surprising, however, but what is very interesting is that when the same experiment was done on medical doctors or medical doctors in training, they too of course experienced pain through a range of subjective experiences. Some of them just like any other person off the street said a particular stimulus of a particular temperature was very painful, other said it wasn't painful at all and some said it was moderately painful. And that turns out to be vitally important for the treatment of pain because pain is not an event in the skin. Pain is a subjective, emotional experience. You may have heard that we have a particular category of these DRGs that innervate the skin, which are called nociceptors. Nociceptor comes from the word noci, nocere I believe it is, which means to harm. However, nociceptors don't carry information about pain, they carry information about particular types of stimuli impacting the skin. And then the brain assigns a value of valence to it, a label and says that's painful. And where people draw the line between not painful and painful varies. Now, because physicians are people and because physicians treat pain, what we know from a lot of data now is that if someone comes into the clinic and says they're experiencing chronic pain or whole body pain or acute pain after an injury or one location, it doesn't really matter what the cause is or even if there's a cause at all, how the doctor reacts to that report of the patient's pain will dictate in many cases the course of treatment. And of course doctors, their goal is to treat the patient to going to the patient's needs, not their own. And that's what good doctors do. However, it's been found and I think now there is work being done to try and change this, but if a doctor has a very high threshold for pain, their interpretation of somebody else's report of pain is going to be different. They might not discount the patient, right? This doesn't necessarily mean that they think, oh, this person their pain is irrelevant, probably not. In fact, from having a high threshold for pain, if someone comes in and says, I'm in extreme pain, that doctor probably thinks, wow, this has to be really, really extreme, but they can be talking about two different experiences. Similarly, if a physician has a very low threshold for pain, and someone comes in and says, yeah, I'm experiencing some pain in my back. I've got the sciatica thing, but yeah, it's a little bit uncomfortable. It's like a, I don't know like a four out of 10. Well, that physician might interpret that four out of 10 as a pretty extreme sense of pain or pretty extreme experience of pain. And so you can start to see how the subjective nature of pain can start to have real impact on the treatment of pain because treatment of pain is carried out by physicians. In fact, there is no objective measure of pain. We can ask how long somebody can keep their hand on a hot plate or in a cold bath. You can do various experiments. They even have some extreme experiments where they'll shave a portion of the leg and they'll put on a very painful chemical compound and see how long people can tolerate that. These are very uncomfortable experiments as you can imagine, but in general, we don't have a way of measuring somebody else's subjective experience of pain. There is no blood pressure measure. There's no heart rate beats per minute measure of pain. So one of the great efforts of neuroscience and of medicine is to try and come up with more objective measures of pain. Similarly, pleasure is something that we all talk about. Ooh, that feels so good, or I love that or more of that please or less of that, but we have no way of gauging what other people are experiencing except what they report through language. And so this is really just to illustrate that this whole thing around pain isn't a black box. We do have an understanding of the elements. There are elements in the skin, there's elements of the brain, there's expectation, anxiety, sleep, and genes, but that it is very complicated. And yet there are certain principles that fall out of that complicated picture that can allow us to better understand and navigate this axis that we call the pleasure-pain axis. So rather than focus on just the subjective nature of pain, let's talk about the absolute qualities of pain and the absolute qualities of pleasure so that we can learn how to navigate those two experiences in ways that serve us each better. First of all, I want to talk about heat and cold. We do indeed have sensors in our skin that respond to heat and cold. And for any of you that have entered a cold shower or a cold body of water of any kind or ice bath, et cetera, you will realize that getting into cold is much harder if you do it slowly. Now, despite that people tend to do it very slowly. I have noticed an enormous variation with which people can embrace the experience of cold. I noticed it because I do some work with athletes and I do some work with military and I do some work with the general public. And one of the best tests of how somebody can handle pain is to ask them to just get into an ice bath. It's not a very sophisticated experience, but it really gets into the core of the kind of circuitry that we're talking about, both in the skin and in the brain. Some people regardless of sex, regardless of age, and regardless of physical ability can just get into the cold. They're somehow able to do it. Now, I don't know what their experience of the cold is. And neither do you. You only know your experience, but they're able to do that. Some do it quickly, some do it slowly. Others find the experience of cold to be so aversive that they somehow cannot get themselves in. They start quaking, they start complaining and many of them just simply get out. They can't do it. Some don't even get in past their knees. This isn't necessarily about pain threshold, but it's related to that. I think it can be helpful to everyone to know that even though it feels better at a mental level to get into the cold slowly and people ask, oh, I just want to get in slowly, I want to take my time. It is actually much worse from a neuro-biological perspective. The neurons that sense cold respond to what are called relative drops in temperature. So it's not about the absolute temperature of the water. It's about the relative change in temperature. So as you move from a particular temperature, whether or not it's in the air next to an ice bath or cold shower, or from a body of water that's warm to a body of water that's colder, or sometimes in the ocean, you'll notice it's warm. And then as you swim out further, you'll get into a pocket of water where it's much colder. That's when the cold receptors in your skin start firing and sending signals up to your brain. Therefore, you can bypass these signals going up to the brain with each relative change one degree change, two degrees change, et cetera, by simply getting in all at once. In fact it is true and maybe you've been told this before, and it is true that if you get into cold water up to your neck, it's actually much more comfortable than if you're halfway in and halfway out. And that's because of the difference in the signals that are being sent from the cold receptors on your upper torso, which is out of the water in your lower torso. Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this to mean that they should just jump into an unknown body of water. There are all sorts of factors like currents, and if it's very, very cold, yes, indeed. You can stop the heart. People can have heart attacks from getting into extremely cold water, like a melted mountain stream that's been frozen all winter, or has been very, very cold or as a snow pack going into it. If very cold, you can indeed have a heart attack. So please be smart about how cold and what bodies of cold water you happen to put yourself into. But it is absolutely true that provided it safe, getting into a cold water is always going to be easier to do quickly and is going to be easier to do up to your neck. In fact, you actually want to get your shoulders submerged. There are a number of other things you can do if you really want and it's safe to do. You can put your face under and activate the so-called dive reflex, which also makes the tolerance of cold easier believe it or not. So it's very counterintuitive. It's like getting into water faster and more completely you will experience as less uncomfortable, less cold. And indeed that's the case. And that's because these cold receptors are measuring every relative drop in temperature. So every single one is graded as we say in biology, it's not absolute. As an additional point, if you're sitting in a body of cold water and it's not circulating, you'll notice that you start to warm up a little bit. Or even if you feel like you're freezing cold, if you move and that water around you moves, of course, then you'll notice it's got even colder. And that's because there's a thermal layer. You're actually heating up the water that surrounds your body like a halo around every aspect of your body. A sort of silhouette of you of heat where you're heating that water. When you move, you disrupt that thermal layer. Now heat is the opposite. Heat and the heat receptors in your skin respond to absolute changes in temperature. And this is probably because our body and our brain can tolerate drops in temperature much better than it can tolerate increases in temperature safely. So when you move from say a standard outdoor environment, I mean, here in the States we measure in terms of Fahrenheit. So maybe it's a 75 or an 80 degree, or even 90 degree day, and you get into a 100 degrees sauna, or if you're in a cool air conditioned building and you go outside and it's very warm outside, you sort of feel like the heat hits you all at once, boom. Hits you all at once, kind of like a slap in the face, but then it will just stay at that level. Your body will acclimate to that particular temperature. However, if that temperature is very, very high, you'll notice that your experience of that heat and your experience of kind of pain and discomfort and your desire to get out of that heat will tend to persist. You don't really adapt in the same way. And certain people who are really good at handling very hot sauna, get better at this. You learned to calm your breathing, et cetera, lower your autonomic arousal. Obviously you don't want to let your body temperature go too high because neurons cook, they die. If neurons die, they don't come back and that's bad. Many people unfortunately harm themselves with hyperthermia. Everyone has a different threshold for this, but in general, you don't want your body temperature to go up too high. That's why a fever of like 103 starts to become worrisome 104. You really get concerned if and it goes up into that range or higher, that's when you need to really cool down the body or get to hospital so they can cool you down. Heat is measured in absolute terms by the neurons. So gradually moving into heat makes sense, and finding that threshold, which is safe and comfortable for you, or if it's uncomfortable, at least resides within that realm of safety. So that's heat and cold, and those are sort of non-negotiables. You can try and lower your level of arousal. In fact, many people who get into a cold shower and ice bath I think the recommendation that I always give is that you have two possible approaches to that. You can either try and relax yourself, kind of just stay calm within the cold, or you can lean into it. You can actually take mental steps to generate more adrenaline to kind of meet the demands of that cold. And at some point we'll do a whole episode on how to use cold and heat to certain advantages we've done a little bit of this in past episodes using the cold to supercharge human performance and things of that sort. But in general, cold is measured in relative terms. And therefore getting in all at once is a good idea provided you can do it safely. And heat is measured in absolute levels by your brain and body and therefore you want to actually move into it gradually. So it's the kind of the inverse of what you might think. One of the most important things to understand about the experience of pain and to really illustrate just how subjective pain really is, is that our experience of pain and the degree of damage to our body are not always correlated. And in fact, sometimes can be in opposite directions. A good example of this would be x-rays. We all occasionally get x-rays at least in the US we get x-rays when we go to the dentist from time to time, and the occasional x-ray might be safe depending on who you are provide you're not pregnant, et cetera. I've gone to the dentist. They put you in the chair, they cover you with the lead blanket, and then they run behind the screen to protect themselves. And they beam me with the x-rays to get a picture of your teeth and your jaws and your skull, et cetera. Well, if you were to get too many x-rays, you could severely damage the tissues of your body, but you don't experience any pain during the x-ray itself. In contrast, you can think that your body is damaged and experienced extreme pain and yet your body can have no damage. A classic example of this was published in the British Journal of Medicine, in which a construction worker fell from I think it was a second story, which he was working and a nail went up and through his boot and he looked down and he saw the nail going through his boot and he was in absolute excruciating pain. They took him to the hospital and because the nail was so long and because of where it had entered, it exited the boot, they had to cut away the boot in order to get to the nail. And when they did that, they revealed that the nail had passed between two of his toes. It had actually failed to impale his body in any way. And yet the view, the perception of that nail entering his boot at one end and exiting the boot at the other was sufficient to create the experience of a nail that had gone through his foot. And the moment he realized that that nail had not gone through his foot, the pain completely evaporated. And this has been demonstrated numerous times. People that work in emergency rooms actually see variations on this. Not always that extreme, but many times what we see and how we perceive that wound or that event has a profound influence on how we experience pain. And I mentioned this, not just because it's a kind of sensational and fantastic example of this extreme, subjective nature of pain, but also because it brings us back to this element which is, we don't know how other people feel. Not just about pain, but about pleasure. We think we do, we have some general sense of whether or not an event ought to be painful or pleasurable, but actually we barely understand how we feel let alone how other people feel, and we can be badly wrong about how we feel meaning we can misinterpret our own sense of pain or our own sense of pleasure depending on what we see with our eyes and what we hear with our ears. So we hear a scream like a shrill scream, and we think it must be pain. And if we look at something that's happening to somebody and it fits a prior category or a prior representation of what we would consider painful stimulus, well, then we think that they're an extreme pain, but actually they might not be in pain at all. Now this highly subjective nature of pain and the way in which we use our visual system to interpret other people's pain and our own pain has actually been leveraged to treat a very extreme form of chronic pain. And it's an absolutely fascinating area of biology and neuroscience. And it's one that we can actually all leverage toward reducing our own levels of pain whenever we are injured. Or believe it or not, even in chronic pain. To describe this area of science requires a kind of extreme example, but I want to be clear that even if you don't suffer from this extreme example, there's relevance and a tool to extract for you. The extreme example is that of an amputated digit, meaning one of your fingers or your toes, or of an amputated limb. So people that have digits or limbs that are gone missing from an injury or surgical removal, will often have the experience that it's still there. The so-called phantom limb phenomenon. Now, why would that be? Well, when you remove a particular finger or limb, obviously that finger and limb is gone and the dorsal root ganglion neuron that would normally send a wire out to that particular region of the body, that wire is no longer there because that portion of the body is no longer there. And in some cases, those neurons die almost always, but not always. However, the map your so-called homunculus, your representation of yourself in the brain is still there. And this map, the so-called homunculus map that you have in that I have is very plastic. It can change. And so as a consequence areas of the map that adjacent to one another can actually start to invade other areas of the map. So for instance, there are neuroimaging studies that have documented that somebody that has say a complete removal of their left arm, the representation of their left arm still exists in the cortex. And experimentally if one is to stimulate that area of the cortex, that person, and if that person were you, would experience having that arm that it were being stimulated, even though it's not there. Now, someone who has an amputated arm doesn't need to have their brain stimulated in order to have the experience of that phantom limb being present. In fact, many people who have limbs that were amputated feel as if that limb is still present even though obviously it's not. And no matter how many times they look to the stump and just see a stump, somehow it doesn't reorganize that homunculus so-called central brain map. Now, that would be fine. You might even think that would be better, better to think you have the arm there than to feel as if it's missing, and yet many people who have amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. They don't feel that the arm is just casually draped next to them. They feel as if it's bunched up and it's an extreme pain. In fact, this kind of contorted stance that I'm taking right here in my chair is not unlike the way that these patients described this. They feel as if it's kind of cramped up, it's very uncomfortable for them. Now, and absolutely creative and you could even say genius scientists by the name of Ramachandra. That's actually his last name, his complete name is a little bit more complicated. So you all almost always hear Ramachandran referred to as Ramachandran or V.S Ramachandran because his full name is Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran. So a lot of letters in there, a lot of vowels, but Ramachandran is a neuroscientist. He was actually a colleague of mine when my lab was formerly at the University of California, San Diego. Has done a lot of work on this phantom limb phenomenon. And Ramachandra actually started off as a vision scientist. And he understood the power of the visual system in dictating our experience of things like pain and pleasure. And so what he developed was a very low technology yet neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment for phantom limb. It consisted of a box, literally a box that had mirrors inside of it. And the patient would put the intact hand or limb into one side, and obviously they couldn't put the amputated limb into the other side, but because of the configuration of the mirrors, it appeared as though they had two symmetric limbs inside the box. And then he would have them look at that limb and move it around. And as they would do this, they would report real time movement, or I should say real time perception of movement in the phantom limb. Now this is absolutely incredible but makes total sense when you think about the so-called top down or contextual modulation of our sensory experience, remember it's anticipation, it's anxiety, it's interpretation of what's happening that drives our perception of what's happening. And so, as he would have these patients move their intact limb to a more relaxed position, the patients would feel as if the phantom limb were relaxing. And this was used successfully to treat phantom limb pain in a number of different people. It didn't always work. And you can imagine sometimes it might be a little trickier like for a leg although there have been leg boxes that have been developed and arranged for this purpose. And what was remarkable is that they could finish these experiments and have the patient, the person enter a state of relaxation, reduced the pain in the phantom limb, and it would stay there even though, of course, as they exited the mirror box, they would go about their life and use their intact limb for its various purposes. I love this experiment because it really speaks to the subjective nature of pain and pleasure. It speaks to the power of the visual system, like what we see just like the nail through the boot experiment. What we see profoundly impacts our experience of pleasure and pain in this case pain. Now, there's another aspect to the phantom limb experience and of these maps, the so-called homunculus maps in the cortex that Ramachandran worked on, which has very interesting and reveals the degree to which these maps are plastic or can change in response to experience. Turns out that because of the locations of different body part representations within these maps, certain parts of our body that normally we don't think of as related can start to create merged experiences. What do I mean by that? Well, Ramchandran described a patient who had a somewhat odd experience of having lost their foot. So they actually had their foot amputated about midway up the Achilles. So lower portion of the calf and foot. I don't recall what the reason was for having it removed. And fortunately for this patient, they did not experience pain in that portion of their body, but rather they confided in him that whenever they would have sex, they would experience their orgasm in their phantom foot in addition to in their genitals, of course. And Ramachandra understood the homunculus map. And he understood that this was because the representation of the foot within the homunculus actually lies adjacent to, and is somewhat interdigitated with it actually kind of merges with the representation of the genitalia. Now that's a weird situation. And yet you now know that the density of innovation of the feet and the genitalia, as well as the lips and the face are actually the highest sensory innervation that you have in your entire body. And this speaks to, I think, a more important general principle for all people of the experience of pleasure or pain, which is that an aspect of our pain or pleasure can be highly localized. It can be because of a cut to a particular location on the body or it can because of a fall injury or a kind of bruise on one side of our body. And yet our experience of pleasure and pain can also be an almost a body-wide experience. And yet it's always most rich. It's always most heightened in these regions of our body that have dense sensory innervation. So we experience pain and pleasure according to local phenomenon receptors in the skin, and this homunculus map that has all these different territories, but because of the way that those territories are related, this kind of wild example of somebody experiencing orgasm in their phantom foot speaks to the larger experience. The more typical rather experience that I should say that all people have, which is that pleasure can be body-wide or we can experience it in our face or the bottoms of our feet and other areas of the body that we experience pleasure and similarly with pain. And that brings us to the topic of whole body pain, not just localized pain, as well as whole body pleasure not just localized pleasure. There are a number of examples of whole body pain that people suffer from. And one common one is called fibromyalgia. I want to just first share with you a little bit of medical insight. A few months back, I did an Instagram live with Dr. Sean Mackey who's an MD medical doctor and a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine that was recorded and placed on my Instagram. If you want to check it out, we can provide a link to that in the show notes. Dr. Mackey is the Chief of the Division of Pain at Stanford School of Medicine. So he's a scientist. He studies pain and he treats patients dealing with various forms of pain, whole body pain, like fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera. And he shared with me something very interesting, which is that anytime you hear or see the word syndrome, that means the medical establishment does not understand what's going on. A syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that point in a particular direction or some general set of directions about what could be going on, but it doesn't reveal a true underlying disease necessarily. It could be aggregative diseases or it could be something else entirely. And I want to make sure that I emphasize the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic and we interpret that as meaning all in one's head. But I think it's important to remember that everything is neural, whether that's pain in your body 'cause you have a gaping wound and you're hemorrhaging out of that wound or whether or not it's pain for which you cannot explain it on the basis of any kind of injury. It's all neural. So saying body, brain, or psychosomatic it's kind of irrelevant. And I hope someday we move past that language. Psychosomatic is interesting. There was a paper that was published in 2015, and then again in 2020 a different paper focused on the so-called psychogenic fevers or psychosomatic effects. I just briefly want to mention this because it relates back to pain. These studies have shown that there are areas of the so-called thalamus, which integrates and filter sensory information of different kinds. And within the brainstem, an area called the DMH and I can also provide a link to this study if you like, that shows that there is a true neurological basis. There are brain areas and circuits that are related to what's called psychogenic fever when we are stressed. And in particular, if we think that we were injured or that we were infected by something, we can actually generate a true fever. It is not an imagined fever. It is our thinking generating an increase in body temperature. And so this has been called psychosomatic. It's been called psychogenic, but it has a neural basis. So when we hear syndrome and a patient comes into a clinic and says that they suffer for instance, from something which is very controversial frankly like chronic fatigue syndrome, some physicians believe that it reflects a real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome means we don't understand. And that doesn't mean something doesn't exist. Fibromyalgia or whole body pain for a long time was written off or kind of explained away by physicians and scientists frankly, my community as one of these syndromes. It couldn't be explained. However, now there is what I would consider and I think others would and should consider from understanding of at least one of the bases for this whole body pain. And that's activation of a particular cell type called glial. And there's a receptor on these glial for those of you that want to know called the toll 4 receptor and activation of the toll 4 receptor is related to certain forms of whole body pain and fibromyalgia. Now, what treatments exist for fibromyalgia. And even if you don't suffer from fibromyalgia, and even if you don't know anyone who does this is important information because what I'm about to tell you relate to how you and your body, which is you of course can deal with pain of any kind. And there are actually things that one can do and take that can encourage nerve health in general. In other conditions like diabetic neuropathy, but in all individuals. So there are clinical data using a prescription drug. This is work that actually was done by Dr. Mackey and colleagues. The drug is called naltrexone. Naltrexone is actually used for the treatment of various opioid addictions and things of that sort, but it turns out that a very low dose, I believe it was a one 10th the size of the typical dose of naltrexone has been shown to have some success in dealing with and treating certain forms of fibromyalgia. And it has that success because of its ability to bind to and block these toll four receptors on glial. So this so-called syndrome or this thing that previously was called a syndrome, fibromyalgia actually has a biological basis. It was not just inpatients heads. And I really tip my hat to the medical establishment including Dr. Mackey and others who explored the potential underlying biologies of things like fibromyalgia and are starting to arrive at treatments. Now, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor, so I'm not prescribing anything. You should talk to your doctor of course, if you have fibromyalgia or other forms of chronic or whole body pain to explore whether or not these low dose naltrexone treatments are right for you. But I think it's a beautiful case study if you will, not a case study of an individual patient, but a case in study of linking up the patient's self-report of these experiences and using science to try to establish clinical treatments. There's another treatment, or I should say there's another approach that one could take. And again, I'm not recommending people do this necessarily. You have to determine what's right and say for you, I cannot do that. There's no way your situation's very far too much, and it would be outside of my wheelhouse to prescribe anything, but there's a particular compound which in the United States is sold over the counter and in Europe is prescription. It's one that I've talked about on this podcast before for other purposes. And that compound is acetylcarnitine. Acetylcarnitine as I mentioned is by prescription in most countries in Europe and the US you can buy this over the counter. There is evidence that acetylcarnitine can reduce the symptoms of chronic whole body pain and other certain forms of acute pain at dosages of somewhere between one to three and sometimes four grams per day. Now acetylcarnitine can be taken orally. It's found in 500 milligram capsules, as well as by injection. By injection in the States in the United States that is also requires a prescription or requires a prescription I should say. The over-the-counter forms are generally capsules or powders. Those apparently do not require a prescription. There are several studies exploring acetylcarnitine in this context, as well as for diabetic neuropathy. And what's interesting about acetylcarnitine is it's one of the few compounds that isn't just used for the treatment of pain, but has also been shown in certain contacts to improve peripheral nerve health generally. And for that reason, it's an interesting compound. I've also talked about acetylcarnitine on here previously, because it has robust effects on things like spur motility and health, including the speeds at which sperms swim, how straight they swim turns out that swimming for sperm is more efficient if they swim straight, as opposed to like those kids in on the swim team, they're like banging up against the lane lines and zigzagging all over the place. So it does turn out to be the case that the quickest route between any two places is a straight line and the good sperm know that, and the less good sperm don't seem to know that. And acetylcarnitine seems to facilitate straight swimming trajectories as well as speed of swimming and overall sperm health. And there is evidence from quality peer reviewed studies showing that acetylcarnitine supplementation can also be beneficial for women's fertility in ways that it affects perhaps we don't really know the mechanism, health and status of the egg or egg implantation. There are a large number of studies on acetylcarnitine. You can look those up on Pub Med, if you like, or on examine.com. There are some studies that I don't think are included there which are particularly interesting. One that I just would like to reference the last name of the first author is Mahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I. The title of the paper is Effects of l -Carnitine Supplementation on Serum Inflammatory Markers and Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes in Females with Knee Osteoarthritis. So this is a randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot study that showed really interesting effects of short term supplementation of acetylcarnitine. Longer term, the effects were less impressive. So it's pretty interesting that this compound has so many different effects. How could it have these effects? Well, it appears that it's having these effects through its impact on the so-called inflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines for those of you that don't know are secreted by the immune system in response to different stressors, physical stressors, mental stressors too food that you eat that isn't good for you. The so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will increase inflammation if they're ingested too often, or in amounts that are too high in quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like C-reactive protein, things like interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 is kind of the generic inflammatory marker that all studies refer to. And yet there are other interleukins, please note that there are other interleukins like interleukin 10 that are anti-inflammatory. So immune system can secrete inflammatory molecules to deal with wounds and stress and things. And in the short term that's good, and in the longterm that's bad. And it can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10. And these matrix metalloproteinases, it's kind of a mouthful, but these matrix metalloproteinases are very interesting. Anytime you see A-S-E, ASE that's generally an enzyme, which means that these compounds in this case, these matrix metalloproteinases are used to break down certain elements around wounds and scoring which might sound like a bad thing, but in some cases is good because it allows certain cells like glial cells so-called microglia to come in like low ambulances, like low paramedics and clean up wounds. So scarring and inflammation is kind of a double-edged sword. It can be good, but too much scarring. If it contains a wound too much, doesn't allow the infiltration of cell types to move in and take care of that wound and heal it up. So it appears that L-carnitine is impacting a number of different processes, both to impact pain and perhaps, and I want to underscore perhaps, but there are good studies happening now, perhaps accelerate wound healing as well. As long as we're talking about acute pain and chronic pain and supplementation and non-prescription drugs, at least in the United States that people can take to deal with pain of various kinds, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two that I get asked most often about, which are agmatine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is sometimes called SAMe. Both of those have been shown to have some impact categorized on examine as notable impact on various forms of pain, due to osteoarthritis, or due to injury of various kinds of indifferent subject population, men, women, people of different ages, et cetera. SAMe in particular has been interesting because it's been shown head to head with drugs like Naproxen and other drugs of that sort, which are well established and sold over the counter in the US to work at least as well as some of those compounds at certain doses. But it's also shown that SAMe and some of those things take more time in order to have those effects. In fact, head to head with things like Neproxin have been shown that they can take up to a month in order to have the pain relieving effect. Now, whether or not that makes them a better choice or a worst choice really depends on your circumstances. I'm certainly not recommending that anybody take anything, but I do think it's interesting and important to point out that things like agmatine, things like SAMe have been shown under certain circumstances to be beneficial for pain and they are outside the realm of prescription drugs. I think this is a growing area of some people call them supplements, some people call them nutraceuticals. Look, at the end of the day these are compounds that affect cellular processes. And the more that we understand how they affect those cellar processes as we now do for things like acetylcarnitine, I think the more trust that we can put into them, or the more to which we might want to avoid them because of some of the side effects or contra-indications that those compounds could have. If you're interested in those other compounds, I do invite you as I always do to check out examine.com, but also to do your research on those compounds by simply putting them into Google or putting them into PubMed, which would be even better. And if you are going to go into PubMed, if you're going to start playing scientist, which I do encourage you to do, I would encourage you to not just read abstracts, but if you can, if the studies are freely available, I realized not all of them are freely available to try and read those studies at least to the extent that you can. There's a particularly nice study that you might look at that was published in 2010 in Pain Medicine, which is Keynan et al K-E-Y-N-A-N, which looked at the safety and efficacy of dietary agmatine sulfate on lumbar disc associated radiculopathy not laughing at the condition. It's a painful condition that describes a, it's a kind of a range of symptoms that relate to pinching of nerves. The spinal columns, I was laughing at my pronunciation of it. That particular study is quite good. And the conclusion of that study that they drew was that there were limited side effects and that dietary agmatine sulfate is safe and efficacious for treating and alleviating pain and improving quality of life and lumbar-disc associated pain. However, there were very specific dosage regimens that were described there and duration of treatment. And so you should not take anything that I say or that study to mean that you can just take this stuff willy-nilly or at any concentration of course, or dose. You always want to pay attention to what the science says. That paper fortunately is freely available online. And we will also provide a link to that study. For those of you that are interested in SAMe and its usage for the treatment of various types of pain, and perhaps other benefits, a number of companies have stopped making SAMe instead what they're now focusing on is what they think is a better or more bioavailable alternative, which is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 5-MTHF. This molecule is necessary for converting homocysteine to methionine, which is then converted to SAMe so rather than taking SAMe directly, the idea is to take something that's upstream of SAMe and make more SAMe endogenously available. This is a different strategy. I've talked about this strategy before for increasing other things like growth hormone, et cetera. There's always this question of whether or not in trying to increase the amount of a particular molecule in the body, whether or not taking that specific molecule was the best thing or working further upstream as it's referred to working on the precursor or increasing the levels of the precursor is the better way to go. It appears that this 5-MTHF is the strategy that people are now taking in place of taking SAMe directly. So in other words, they're taking this in order to get elevated levels of SAMe. Now, I'd like to turn our attention to a completely non drug, non supplement related approach to dealing with pain. And it's one that has existed for thousands of years. And that only recently has the Western scientific community started to pay serious attention to, but they have started to pay serious attention to it. And there is terrific mechanistic science to now explain how and why acupuncture can work very well for the treatment of certain forms of pain. Now, first off, I want to tell you what was told to me by our director or Chief of the Pain Division at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey, which was that some people respond very well to acupuncture and others do not. And the challenge is identifying who'll respond well and who won't respond well. Now, when I say won't respond well, that doesn't necessarily mean that they responded in a negative way, that it was bad for them, but it does appear that a fraction of people experienced tremendous pain relief from acupuncture and others experience none at all or very little to the point where they have to seek out other forms of treatment. The science on this is still ongoing. There was actually an excellent paper published on this in the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the premier medical clinical journals. And it basically reinforced the idea that you have responders and non-responders. A number of laboratories have started to explore how acupuncture works. And one of the premier laboratories for this is Qiufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School. Qiufu has spent many years studying the pain system and a system that's related to the pain system, which is the system that controls our sensation of itch. Just as a brief aside about itch, itch and pain are often co associated with one another. I was recently in Texas, and I will tell you, they have some mean mosquitoes. They're small, but whatever they're injecting into your skin. Well, here I am talking now about my subjective experience of pain, whatever they injected into my skin felt to me like the most extreme mosquito bites I've ever had, not while they were biting me, not while they were injecting the venom, but boy, those Texas mosquitoes make me itch. How do they do it? Well, their venom creates little packets of so-called histamine that travel around those packets are called mast cells, little packets of histamine that go to that location and make me and presumably you want to scratch those mosquito bites. I scratch mine you scratch yours, but we both scratch our mosquito bites. And when we do that, the histamines are released. That gets red and inflamed and the itch even worse. The inflammation is actually caused by the histamine. Well, that experience of inflammation and pain and itch is what we call a pyrogenic experience. So we we have pain which is nociception, essentially, I know that the pain of aficionado always get a little upset because they say, oh, there's no such thing as as a pain receptor, it's no susceptive receptors and pain is subjective experience. Yes, I acknowledge all that. But for fluency, let's just think about pain as a certain experience and itch as a separate experience, but they often exist together because those mosquito bites were what I would call painful, or at least not pleasant. They didn't just itch, they were also painful nuts because itch brings with it inflammation and inflammation often brings with it pain relief, but it can also bring with it the sensation of pain. So itch and pain are two separate phenomenon. It was actually discovered through a really interesting phenomenon that relates to something that is actually consumed in supplement form, which is this tropical legume. It's actually a bean called Mucuna pruriens. That's M-U-C-U-N-A that's one word P-R-U-I-E-N-S Mucuna pruriens is a bean, it's as legume that this bean is 99% L-DOPA. It's dopamine or rather it's the precursor to dopamine and people buy this stuff and take it over the counter as ways to increase their levels of dopamine. It does make you feel really dopamine doubt, meaning it makes you feel a little high and really motivated and really energetic a lot like other drugs that will do that. I don't necessarily recommend taking Mucuna pruriens. I personally don't like taking it. Doesn't make me feel good. I crash really hard when I take it. But on the outside of this bean is a compound that makes people itch. So they remove this when you take it in supplement form. In fact, it's usually in capsule form, but the outside of this bean, it's like a hairy bean. And those little hairs contain a compound, which was actually used to study and identify these itchy receptors in the skin. So we don't have time to go into all the details of itch, but it's pretty interesting that you have these compounds out in nature that can make us itch. Inside them they have dopamine. I mean, this is really weird, but plant compounds are really powerful. So don't let anyone tell you that because something's from a plant or an earth that it's not powerful. There are very powerful plant and herb compounds. Mucuna prurien being one of them with dopamine on the inside and itchy stuff on the outside. Now, what does this all have to do with acupuncture? Well, Qiufu Ma's lab has not just identified the itch pathway, this pruritus genes as they're called, which causes itch and the pyrogenic phenomenon of itch being separate from pain. His lab has also studied how acupuncture causes relief of, but also can exacerbate pain. Now, the form of acupuncture that they explored was one that's commonly in use called electroacupuncture. So this isn't just putting little needles into different parts of the body. These needles are able to pass an electrical current, not magically, but because they have a little wire going back to a device and you can pass electrical current. Here's what they found. This is a study published in the journal neuron Cell Press journal, excellent journal, very high stringency. So what Qiufu Ma's lab found was that if electroacupuncture is provided to the abdomen, to the stomach area, it creates activation of what are called the sympathetic ganglia. These have nothing to do with sympathy in the emotional sense has to do with the stress response. Sympa just means together. So it activated a bunch of neurons along the spinal cord. And the activation of these neurons evolves neural adrenaline and something called NPY neuropeptide Y. The long and short of it is that stimulating the abdomen with electroacupuncture was either anti-inflammatory or it could cause inflammation. It could actually exacerbate inflammation depending on whether or not it was of low or high intensity. Now that makes it a very precarious technique. And this may speak to some of the reason why some people report relief from acupuncture and others do not. However, they went a step further and stimulated other areas of the body using electroacupuncture. And what they found is that stimulation of the legs of the hind limbs, as it's called an animals, and the legs in humans caused a circuit, a neural circuit to be activated that goes from the legs up to an area of the base of the brain called the DMV not the DMH, which I mentioned earlier, but the DMV like you go to the DMV, which is a miserable experience for most people, forgive me, DMV employees, but let's be honest most people don't enjoy going to the DMV as patrons, but we have to so we go. The DMV and low intensity stimulation, this electroacupuncture of the hind limbs activated the DMV and activated the adrenal glands, which sit at top of your kidneys and cause the release of what are called catecholamines. And those were strongly anti-inflammatory. In other words, electroacupuncture of the legs and feet can, if done correctly, be anti-inflammatory and reduce symptoms of pain. And can we think accelerate wound healing because activations of these catecholaminergic pathways can accelerate wound healing as well. So the takeaway from this is that while there are thousands of years and millions of subjects involved in explorations of electroacupuncture and acupuncture, Western medicine is starting to come into this and start to explore underlying mechanism. Now, for those of you that love acupuncture and are real proponents of it, it's worked for you, you might say, well, why does Western medicine even need to come into this? Why should they even be exploring this? But we should all be relieved that they are because what's starting to happen now is that as the mechanistic basis for this is starting to come to light, insurance coverage of things like acupuncture is starting to emerge as well. And this is in contrast to other therapies for which there's a lot of anecdotal evidence, but very little mechanistic understanding. One example of that would be laser photo biomodulation the use of lasers of different types really to treat pain and to accelerate wound healing. A lot of people claim that this can really help them. However, most places, at least in the States, won't cover this with insurance or don't perform this in standard clinics. And the reason is the underlying mechanism isn't known. I'm not going to get into the argument about whether or not mechanistic understanding should or should not be required in order to have insurance coverage of things that work. That's not what this is about. And that actually will be a boring discussion because I'm shouting at a tunnel through you. And I wouldn't be able to hear you shout back no matter what your stance on that is, but just trust me when I say that I am both relieved and delighted to hear that excellent medical institutions like Stanford are starting to think about electroacupuncture and how it can work. That places like Harvard Medical School are starting to explore this at a mechanistic level. And I do believe that there's an open-mindedness that starting to emerge for instance, the National Institutes of Health, not only has an institute for mental health and cancer research and an eye institute, but now complementary health, the so-called NCCIH. National Institutes of Complementary Health that is exploring things like electroacupuncture, meditation, various supplements and things of those sort. I do think that we're entering a new realm in which things like pain and pain management will be met with more openness by all physicians, at least that's my hope. So please take that into consideration right now. The mechanistic evidence for laser photobiomodulation is not strong. One of the major issues or the barriers to that is that most of the studies that are out there were actually paid for by companies that build devices for laser photobiomodulation. And so we really need independent studies funded by federal institutions that have no bias or financial relationship in order to gain trust in whatever data happen to emerge. There is a technique that at one time was considered alternative, but now has a lot of mechanistic science to explain how it works, and it does indeed work for the treatment of chronic and also for acute pain. And that treatment is hypnosis in particular self-hypnosis. Now, my colleague at Stanford in fact, my collaborator, Dr. David Spiegel, our Associate Chair of Psychiatry has devoted his professional life to developing hypnosis tools that people can use to help them sleep better, focus better, stay motivated, et cetera. While most people hear hypnosis and they think, oh, this is stage hypnosis. People walking around like chickens are being forced to laugh or fall asleep on command, et cetera. This is completely different than all that. This is self hypnosis and there are now dozens, if not more quality peer reviewed studies published in excellent journals done by Dr. Spiegel and others at other universities. It really all has to do with how self-hypnosis can modulate activity of the prefrontal cortex and related structures like the insula. The prefrontal cortex is involved in our executive function as it's called, our planning, our decision making, but also how we interpret context, what the meaning of a given sensation is. And that's extremely powerful. I just want to remind everybody that the currency of the brain and body has not changed in hundreds of thousands of years. It's always been dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, testosterone, estrogen. What's changed are the contingencies, the events in the world that drive whether or not we get an increase or decrease in testosterone or estrogen, the events in the world that dictate whether or not we get an increase or a decrease in dopamine. Believe me, the events that drove those increases and decreases were very different even a 100 years ago than they are now. And as we create new things and societies change, et cetera, they will continue to exchange information in the same currency, which is dopamine, serotonin, and all these other neuromodulators and chemicals. Hypnosis takes advantage of this by allowing an individual, you, if you like to change the way that you interpret particular events and to actually experience what would be painful as less painful or not painful. And that's just the example of pain. Hypnosis is powerful for other reasons too. It actually can help rewire neural circuits so that you don't experience as much pain so that you can sleep faster, focus faster. If this is all sounding very fantastical well, it's supported by data. The data are that when people do self-hypnosis even brief self-hypnosis of 10 or 15 minutes, a few times a week, maybe even returned to that hypnosis by just using a one minute a day hypnosis, they can achieve significant and often very impressive degrees of pain relief in chronic pain whether or not that chronic pain arises through things like fibromyalgia or through other sources. If you want to check this out, there's a wonderful zero cost resource that's grounded in this work. It's the app reveri.com. So R-E-V-E-R-I.com. There you can download a zero cost app for Apple phones or for Android phones. And there are a variety of different hypnosis scripts. These are actually self hypnosis scripts, and you'll actually hear Dr. David Spiegel talking to you. He can teach you about hypnosis and how it works. There are links to scientific studies that web address that I gave you before reveri.com. You can see the various studies and the various write-ups related to those studies and how this all works. And they're simple protocols. You just click on a tab and you listen to the self-hypnosis and it will take you into hypnosis. And several of those hypnosis grips have been shown clinically to relieve certain patterns of chronic pain. So it's a powerful tool, and I encourage you not to write off the non-drug non supplement tools as less than powerful because indeed many people experience tremendous relief from them. And of course, they also can be combined with drug treatments if that's right for you or with supplements and things of that sort to treat pain, if that's right for you. So again, electroacupuncture now often supported by insurance, not always, but often. Great mechanistic data starting to emerge. Hypnosis, terrific tool. There's even the self-hypnosis tool that one can access through the zero cost app Reveri and lots of great clinical data and scientific mechanistic data. There are neuro imaging studies showing that different brain areas are activated in hypnosis the so-called default network, kind of where your brains is kind of idols and the different circuits that are active in at rest shift with hypnosis and shift long-term in ways that positively conserve you. And then these things like laser photobiomodulation still more or less in that experimental medical community. I should say, Western Medical Community, not so certain, but hopefully there will be data soon, and hopefully those data will point to mechanisms that allow the insurance companies and other sort of medical bodies to support them if indeed they have a mechanistic basis. I just want to briefly touch on a common method of pain relief that speaks to a more general principle of how things like electroacupuncture, and also some of these new emerging techniques of kind of like active tissue release and this principle that you hear a lot about in sports medicine now that when you have pain or injury at one site, that you should provide pressure above and below that site. You may have seen this in the Olympics, which is ongoing now where people will put tape on their body at certain locations oftentimes. The logic or what they're saying is that this is designed to create relief in a joint or in a limb that's below the tape, not necessarily under the tape, but above or below. So for instance, if there's pain in one shoulder, sometimes we'll put it on the trapezius muscle or things of that sort. It turns out that there is a basis for this because of the way that these different nerves run in from the skin and from the muscles up into the spinal cord and into the brainstem providing pressure on one nerve pathway can often impact another pathway. And the simplest and most common example of this is one that we all do instinctually or intuitively even animals do this. This is something that in the textbooks is all is called the Gate Theory of Pain developed by Melzack and Wall kind of classic theory. Basically we have receptors in our skin, the so-called C fibers, that's just a name for these little wires that come from a particular class of DRGs that's very thin that brings about certain kinds of nasal scepter information. I want to say pain information, but then the pain people believe are not their pain people. Sometimes they're a pain because what they tell me is they're on pain receptors okay, nociceptors That information comes in C fibers and what happens when we injure something well, provided that we won't damage it worse by touching it, oftentimes what we will do is we will rub the source of pain or the location in which we were experiencing pain. And it turns out that's not an unuseful thing to do. When we rub our skin or an area, or we provide pressure nearby it, we activate the so-called A fibers, the bigger wires and neurons that innovate, meaning they jut into that area of skin. And those A fibers, the ones that respond to mechanical pressure actually are able to inhibit those C fibers, the ones that are carrying that so-called pain information. So rubbing an area or providing pressure above or below an injury actually provides real pain relief support for the location of that injury or that pain because of the way that these different patterns or these different types of neurons interact with one another. And when I say it inhibits it, I don't mean that it like shouts at it, what it does is it releases it's literally kind of like vomits up a little bit of a neurotransmitter called GABA. And GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits it quiets the activity of other neurons. And so it's acting as kind of an analgesic, if you will, it's acting as its own form of drug that you make with your body to quiet the activity of these pain neurons. So rubbing a wound provided it doesn't damage the wound worse or providing pressure above or below typically it's above a particular injury can have a real effect in relieving some of the pain of that injury. And some people have speculated this as through fascia, or this is through other bodily organs and tissues. And it might be we're going to do a whole episode on fascia. It's extremely interesting tissue, but right now it seems that the main source of that pain relief is through this A fiber inhibition of these C fibers so-called Melzack and Wall Gate Theory of Pain if you'd like to look it up and learn about that further. Now, let's talk about a phenomenon that has long intrigued and perplexed people for probably thousands of years. And that's redheads. You may have heard before that redheads have a higher pain threshold than other individuals. And indeed, that is true. There's now a study that looked at this mechanistically. There's a gene called the MC1R gene. And this MC1R gene encodes for a number of different proteins. Some of those proteins of course are related to the production of melanin. This is why redheads often not always, but often are very fair skinned. Sometimes have freckles, not always. And of course have red hair. Some people are really intense ginger's not psychologically or emotionally intense perhaps that too, but meaning their hair is very, very red. Others, it's a lighter red. So of course there's variation here, but this gene, this MC1R gene is associated with a pathway that relates to something that I've talked about on this podcast before during the episode on hunger and feeding and this is POMC. POMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin and POMC is cut up. It's cleaved into different hormones, including one that enhances pain perception. This is melanocyte stimulating hormone. And another one that blocks pain beta endorphin. Now, if you listen to the episodes on testosterone and estrogen and the episodes on hunger and feeding, some of these molecules will start to ring a bell. Things like melano stimulating hormone relate to pigmentation of the skin relate to sexual arousal, et cetera, but it turns out that in red heads, because of the fact that they have this gene, this MC1R gene, the POMC Pro-opiomelanocortin, that's cut into different hormones, melanocyte-stimulating hormones and another one beta endorphin. Beta endorphin should cue you to the fact that this is in the pain pathway. The endorphins are endogenously made, meaning made within our body opioids. They actually make us feel numb in response to certain kinds of pain. Now, not completely numb, but they numb or reduce our perception of pain because of the ways in which they are released from certain brain centers. We'll talk about those brain centers in a moment. So what's really interesting is that this study showed that the presence of these hormones is in everybody. We all have melanocortin 4, we all have beta endorphins. We all have POMC et cetera, but red heads make more of these endogenous endorphins. And that's interesting. It allows them to buffer against the pain response. I have a personal anecdote to share with you about this red head and heightened levels of pain tolerance phenomenon. Obviously I'm not a redhead. I don't dye my hair, but my partner for many years was a red head and still is a red head. She had bright red hair and had that since childhood. Well, we had the fortunate experience of becoming friends with Wim Hof and family. They actually came out to visit us and did a series of seminars in the bay area. This was in 2016, as I recall. And my partner, she had never done an ice bath. She had never done any kind of real cold water exposure experience before, but as one particular gathering as is often the case when women's around, there was an ice bath and a number of people were getting into this thing. This was actually before a dinner event. And I think for most people who have never done an ice bath getting in for 30 seconds or a minute is tolerable, but it takes some effort. It takes some willpower and take some overcoming that pain barrier 'cause it is a little bit painful. Not a lot. Some people can stay in longer three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. What was incredible is that without any desire to compete with anybody else, my partner redhead got into the ice bath and just like sat there for 10 minutes. In fact, at one point she just kind of turned to me and said, \"I don't really feel pain. I'm not really in pain.\" And Wim loved this. Wim thought it was great. He thought it was the most terrific thing in the world. And he got back in the ice bath and they became fast friends, and I think they're probably still fast friends. So in any event, that's an end of one. What we call an anecdata example. Anecdata is not really a term that we should use too much 'cause it's N of one anecdotes are just that. They're just anecdotes. But it's been described many times in various clinics by anesthesiologists, by observation of coaches, et cetera, that redheads men and women who are redheads seem to have this higher pain threshold. And it does seem to be because their body naturally produces ways to counter the pain response. They produce their own endogenous opioids. Now this of course should not be taken to mean that redheads can tolerate more pain and therefore should be subjected to more pain, all it means is that their threshold for pain on average, not all of them, but on average is shifted higher than that of other individuals. And it remains to be determined whether or not other light skin, light haired individuals also have a heightened level of pain threshold. And I should mention because I mentioned the ice bath that of course pain threshold is something that can be built up and provide you do that safely in ways that aren't damaging your tissues because of course, pain is a signal that is designed to help you to keep from harming yourself, but provided that you can do that in a way that's safe and doesn't damage your tissues, increasing your pain threshold through the use of things like ice baths is something that really can be done. It has a lot to do with these contextual or top-down modulations of the experience. You can tell yourself that this is good for me, or I'm doing this by choice or whatever it is. You can distract yourself. There are a huge number of different ways that one could do that. One of the more interesting ways for which there are actually really good scientific data come from my colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. And that actually looked at how love and in particular, the experience of obsessive love could actually counter the pain response, not just in redheads, but in everybody. So that study I'll just briefly describe it involved having people come into the laboratory and experience any one or a number of different painful stimuli, but they had selectively recruited subjects that were in new relationships for which there was a high degree of infatuation so much so that the people couldn't stop thinking about or communicating with that new partner up to 80% of their waking time, which is a lot. That constant obsessing about that partner was correlated with. It wasn't causal necessarily, but was correlated with the ability to sustain higher levels of pain than people who were in more typical non obsessive forms of love, longstanding relationships, where there wasn't long obsessive love rather. And of course in this study, there were a lot of good control groups. They included a distractor, they included people obsessing about other things, their pet, et cetera. They included other forms of love and attachment, but it does seem that certain patterns of thinking can allow us to buffer ourselves against the pain response. And that should not be surprising. Certain forms of thinking are associated with the release of particular neuromodulators in particular dopamine. And dopamine, it may seem is kind of the thing that underlies everything, but it's not. Dopamine is a molecule that's associated with novelty expectation, motivation, and reward. We talked about this at the beginning of the episode, that it's really the molecule of expectation and motivation and hope and excitement more than it's associated with the receival of the reward. Well, dopamine is coursing throughout the brain at heightened levels and coursing throughout the body at heightened levels when we fall in love. This probably has some adaptive mechanism that ensure paired bonding between people or who knows, maybe it ensured not bonding to multiple people. Nobody really knows how dopamine functions in terms of pair bonding, but it is known that when people fall in love, new relationships create very high levels of dopamine. And that's probably the mechanistic basis by which these people were able to buffer the pain response by thinking about their partner or this new relationship that they're in almost obsessively or obsessively. Now that raises a deeper question we should always be asking. Yeah, but how, how? Well, the dopamine system can have powerful effects on the inflammation system. And it doesn't do this through mysterious ways. It does this by interacting through the brainstem and some of the neurons that innervate the spleen and other areas of the body, that deploy cells to go combat infection, inflammation, and pain. And the ways in which dopamine can modulate pain, and in this case, this particular study transform our experience of pain. Maybe even to something that's pleasureful is not mysterious. It's really through the activation of brainstem neurons that communicate with areas of our body, that deploy things like immune cells. So for instance, we have neurons in our brain stem that can be modulated by the release of dopamine and those neurons in the brainstem control the release of immune cells from tissues like the spleen or organs like the spleen. And those immune cells can then go combat infection. We've heard before that when we're happy, we're better able to combat infection, deal with pain, deal with all sorts of things that essentially makes us more resilient. And that's not because dopamine is some magic molecule, it's because dopamine affects particular circuits and tells in a very neuro-biological way in a biochemical way tells those cells and circuits that conditions are good. Despite the fact that there's pain in the body conditions are good. You're in love or conditions are good. You want to be in this experience. Or conditions are good this is for a greater cause that you're fighting or suffering for some larger purpose. So all of that has existed largely in the realm of psychology and even motivational literature in this kind of thing, but there's a real mechanistic basis for it. Dopamine is a molecule that can bind to receptor sites on these brain areas. Those brain areas can then modulate the organs and tissues of the body that can allow us to lean into challenge. And those challenges can be infection, it can be physical pain, it can be long bouts of effort that are required of us. And I think many people have described the feeling of being newly in love as a heightened level of energy, a capacity do anything. I mean, the whole concept of a muse is one in which some individual or some thing either imagined or real enters our life and we can use that as fuel. And that fuel is chemical fuel and that chemical fuel is dopamine. And it really does allow for more resilience and can even transform the experience of pain or what would otherwise be pain into an experience of pleasure. So, along those lines, let's talk about pleasure. With all the cells and tissues and machinery related to pain, you might think that our entire touch system is designed to allow us to detect pain and to avoid tissue damage and well, a good percentage of it is devoted to that. A good percentage of it is also devoted to this thing that we call pleasure. And that should come as no surprise. Pleasure isn't just there for our pleasure. It serves adaptive role, and that adaptive role relates to the fact that every species has a primary goal which is to make more of itself otherwise it would go extinct. That process of making more of itself sexual reproduction is closely associated with the sensation and the perception of pleasure. And it's no surprise that not only is the highest density of sensory receptors in and on and around the genitalia, but the process of reproduction evokes sensations and molecules and perceptions associated with pleasure. And the currency of pleasure exists in multiple chemical systems but the primary ones are the dopamine system, which is the anticipation of pleasure and the work required to achieve the ability to experience that pleasure, and the serotonin system which is more closely related to the immediate experience of that pleasure. And from dopamine and serotonin stem out other hormones and molecules, things like oxytocin, which are associated with pair bonding. Oxytocin is more closely associated with the serotonin system biochemically and at the circuit level meaning the areas of the brain and body that manufacture a lot of serotonin, usually not always, but usually contain neurons that also manufacturer and make use of the molecule oxytocin. Those chemicals together create sensations of warmth, of well being, of safety. The dopamine molecule is more closely associated with hormones like testosterone and other molecules involved with pursuit and further effort in order to get more of whatever could potentially cause more release of dopamine. So this is a very broad strokes, no pun intended description of the pleasure system. There are of course, other molecules as well. One in particular that's very interesting is something called PEA. PEA, it stands for Phenethylamine sometimes also referred to as Phenethylamine depending on who you are and where you live, how you pronounce it doesn't really matter. PEA is a molecule, which is incredibly potent at augmenting or increasing the activity of certain cells and neural circuits that relate to the pleasure system. PEA has purportedly been thought to be released in response to ingestion of things like certain forms of dark chocolate. Some people take it in supplement form. It's a bit of a stimulant, but it also seems to heighten the perception of pleasure in response to a particular amount of dopamine and or serotonin. So for instance, in a kind of a arbitrary experiment and units type example, if a given experience evokes a particular amount of serotonin and dopamine and gives rise to a subjective experience of pleasure of say level three out of 10, the ingestion of PEA prior to that experience can increase the rating of that experience as more pleasureful. Maybe a four or a five, or even a six. And PEA is known to be present in or I should say it's releases stimulated by a number of different compounds, such as dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame and certain people can actually increase the amount of PEA released. Some of these glutamate related molecules like aspartame or things are in the glutamate pathway can increase PEA release. And then some people will actually take PEA in supplement form for its mild stimulant properties as well as for increasing the perception of, or the ability to experience pleasure. It's not a sledgehammer. It's not like dopamine itself. People that take things like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA or drugs of abuse, which I certainly don't recommend things like cocaine or amphetamine experience tremendous increases in dopamine, not so much increases in serotonin. Some people will take serotonin in precursor form like 5HTP or serotonin itself, or they'll take the amino acid precursor like tryptophan. I'm not saying these things as recommendations for increasingly one sense of pleasure, I'm describing them because of what they do generally falls into two categories. The first category is to raise the foundation, what we call the tonic level of dopamine and serotonin. So if levels of serotonin and dopamine are too low, it becomes almost impossible to experience pleasure. There's a so-called anhedonia. This is also described as depression. Although it needn't be long-term depression. So certain drugs like antidepressants like Wellbutrin Bupropion as it's commonly called or the so-called SSRI, the serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft and similar will increase dopamine and serotonin respectively. They're not increasing the peaks in those molecules. What we call the acute release of those molecules, what they're doing is they're raising the overall levels of those molecules. They're raising the sort of foundation or the tide if you will, think about it as your mood or your pleasure rather is like a boat, and if it's on the shore and it can't get out to sea, unless that tide is high enough, that's kind of the way to think about these tonic levels of dopamine and serotonin. Now, most of us fortunately, do not have problems with our baseline or autonic levels of dopamine and serotonin release. Things like PEA in that case will cause a slight increase in that tide and make the ability of certain experiences to increase dopamine further more available. What we call this in neurosciences so-called gain control. I can kind of turn up the volume, bring us closer to the threshold to activate certain circuits. And this is really what we mean when we say a neuromodulator, okay? This is why when you are very happy about something, let's say you're out with your friends. You're really excited. Maybe depending on where you live and what's going on in your area of the world right now, like I have a niece and she's been locked up in quarantine for a long time recently because it was deemed safe. She got to go to summer camp. I have never seen that kid so happy to spend with her friends. She was so excited and it was really amazing to see how excited she was. Her baseline levels of dopamine were clearly up so much so that when she saw her friends, she literally started squealing. They were squealing, she was squealing. Everyone was squealing. I wasn't squealing. I would admit it if I was squealing. I wasn't squealing, but it was such a delight to see and I'm sure that made my dopamine levels go up, which was, she was just so excited such that anything and everything felt like an exciting stimulus. This is pleasure, right? And I don't want to write off the experience from an neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite the opposite. It's really beautiful to see again this principle that different experiences and the experience of pleasure from different things. Seeing your friends for the first time, summer camp for a kid, whatever it might happen to be use the same currency, dopamine use the same currency serotonin. And this is a principle that I hope in listening to this podcast and even some of it's repetitive features from one episode to the next. I'm hoping that those will start to embed in your mind that the brain and body use these common currencies for different experiences. So yes, if your dopamine and serotonin, or I should say if your dopamine and or serotonin levels are too low, it will be very hard to achieve pleasure to experience physical pleasure or emotional pleasure of any kind. That's why treatments of the sort that I described a minute ago might be right for you. Obviously we can't determine if they're right for you. It's also why they have side effects. If you artificially increase these molecules they're associated with pleasure, oftentimes you get a lack of motivation to go seek things like food. People don't get much interest in food 'cause why should they if their serotonin levels are already up. Again, there's a ton of individual variation. I don't want to say that these antidepressants are always bad. Sometimes they've saved lives. They've saved millions of lives. Sometimes people have side effects that make them not the right choice. So it has to be determined for the individual. Things like PEA or a more subtle effect. I should mention PEA supplementation is something that a number of people use but it's very short-lived. Because of the half-life of this molecule was very brief, the effect only lasts about 20 minutes or so. Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead to longer baseline increases in dopamine. But remember, any time you raise a baseline, you reduce the so-called signal to noise. What it means is if you're riding around at really high dopamine, at first, everything will start to seem exciting like my niece and seeing her friends for the first time. Everything's exciting. But then what will happen is when your dopamine levels return to more normal levels, it will take a much greater dopamine increase of much bigger event, more novel, more exciting in order to achieve the sense that what you're experiencing is pleasureful. And this is because of the relationship between pleasure and pain. Now, in a future episode we are going to go deep into this relationship between pleasure and pain, but just briefly as a precursor to that and because it's relevant to the conversation that we've been having, you might want to be wary of any experience, any experience, no matter how it arrives, chemical, physical, emotional, or some combination, you might want to be wary of letting your dopamine go too high and certainly you want to be wary of it going too low. Because of the way that these circuits adjust. Basically every time that the pleasure system is kicked in in high gear, an absolutely spectacular event, you cannot be more ecstatic. There is a mirror symmetric activation of the pain system. And this might seem like an evil curse of biology, but it's not. This is actually a way to protect this whole system of reward and motivation that I talked about at the beginning of the episode. It might sound great to just ingest substances or engage in behaviors where it's just dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, and just constantly be motivated, but the system will eventually crash. And so what happens is when you have a big increase in dopamine, you also will get a big increase in the circuits that underlie our sense of disappointment and re adjusting the balance. And with repeated exposure to high levels of dopamine, not naturally occurring wonderful events, but really high chemically induced peaks in dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks in dopamine. What happens is those peaks in dopamine start to go down and down and down in response to the same, what ought to be incredible experience. We start to what's called habituate or attenuate, and yet the pain increases in size. And this has a preservative function in keeping us safe, believe it or not. But what I just described is actually the basis of most if not all, forms of addiction something that we will deal with in a future episode in depth. So what should you think about all? How should you think about pleasure and how should you think about pain? What is too much pleasure? Well, that's going to differ from person to person, but to the extent that one can access pleasure repeatedly over time, ideally without chemical augmentation, certainly not excessive chemical augmentation, that means that this pleasure system is tuned up well and can continue to experience pleasure. However, if you find yourself engaging in the same behavior over and over again, but achieving less and less pleasure from it, chances are you want to adjust down how often you engage in that behavior. And or adjust down your expectation of reward every time you engage in that behavior. What do I mean by that? Well, at the beginning of the episode I talked about how dopamine will allow us to get into bouts of hard work. We will work very hard to pursue a reward, and that's really what dopamine does. And then when the reward comes that doesn't increase our dopamine. In fact, our dopamine levels go down. One of the key things that we can all do to adjust our ability to experience pleasure is to engage in that intermittent reward schedule. You can either adjust down the peak in dopamine, meaning not let yourself ever get too happy, but that's no fun, right? Life is about occasionally achieving or experiencing ecstasy, but every once in a while, remove the reward. And of course, I don't mean ecstasy the drug that's a separate matter. The MDMA trials are a separate matter. Very interesting, I want to be clear. I meant psychological and physical ecstasy of the natural sort. I've immense interest in what's going on in the MDMA trials, but just for clarity purposes, that's a separate topic that we will cover in an episode very soon. So how do you adjust this dopamine system? Well, every once in a while at random, not in a predictable way, you remove the reward and that will keep you and your dopamine system tune up in the proper ways. The gain of the dopamine system, as we say, will be adjusted so that you can continue to experience dopamine and serotonin when you actually get the reward. This can be translated into a huge number of different domains, but I want to give some examples because I'm sure that many of you are asking, wait, what does this actually mean? Okay, let's say you're a student, or this could be a student in academia, or this could be a student of a physical practice. Every once in a while when you do something really well, maybe that's even just showing up to the practice rather than pat yourself on the back, just tell yourself yeah, that's the minimum that's expected of me. When everyone's excited about something that you're doing, maybe you're excited about it, try and adjust down your excitement a little bit. I know this might seem counterintuitive, but you're preserving the ability to experience excitement in a variety of contexts. Let's say you get a big monetary award. Well, that's great. I'm happy for you. And that's wonderful. However, you should be a little bit wary if you care about your dopamine system and you care about your ability to get subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter which through effort, if you want to be able to maintain the ability to exert effort, well, then you probably wouldn't want to run out and immediately buy something with that monetary reward. In other words, you wouldn't want to layer on more dopamine release, okay? You might, but you might not. You might skip it. What you'll find then is that your motivation is essentially infinite. This is what I described at the beginning of the episode. And again, it's because dopamine is this currency. It's like these days you hear a lot about Bitcoin, and Ethereum, and Dogecoin, and USs dollars, and Euros and other stuff. But the currency that you use in your body doesn't matter what external currency those are. In fact, as you watch the value of different currencies go up whether or not it's cryptocurrency or standard currency, the value is actually reflective of the dopamine that exists inside of people. So all the excitement about a particular currency crypto or otherwise is really just dopamine. That's the currency that we all use. And there's no negotiating that. That's just the way that we're built. Now, to give yet other examples. Let's say you're teaching other people how to do something and they do something exceptionally well. If you reward them every single time. and in particular, if you reward them with something that's even greater than the experience of what they did. So let's say kids win a soccer game and they're ecstatic. They're jumping all over the place. They're super excited and you reward them with an even bigger experience, a celebration, you are actually inhibiting their ability to perform the same set of activities that led them to the win if, and I really want to underscore if you reward them every time. Of course we should reward kids and each other and ourselves for our accomplishments, but you don't want to do it every time. And sure there will be some disappointment from suddenly removing the reward that you expected, but that's exactly the point. That's what keeps these circuits tuned up properly. Now there's the other form of pleasure, which is the more immediate visceral or sensory experience of pleasure. This is distinct from goals and goal-directed behavior. I'm talking about the immediate experience. This is more of the serotonergic system. There are other systems involved too, but this is also the system that draws out those endogenous opioids from a particular structure. We have a structure in the back of our brain called PAG P-A-G, it's the periaqueductal gray area. Very interesting brain area that is associated with pain, but also with pleasure because under certain conditions, it deploys endogenous opioids and gives us a kind of blissed out feeling. This is not like the opioids of the opioid epidemic sort that people take and unfortunately have led to tremendous amounts of suffering and abuse. These are endogenously released opioids. These are the kinds of opioids that come out from long distance bouts of physical exercise and running. These are the opioids that are deployed in response to giving birth and overcoming the tremendous pain of childbirth. So PAG is very contextual and there are few types of stimuli or I should say events in life... I'm really showing my nerdy side. There are a few types of stimulate, I'm talking about experiences that evoke endogenous opioid release from PAG. One is sexual activity. Sexual activity can increase pain threshold. And here I am not suggesting or getting involved in anyone's particular proclivities or personal experiences. You're welcome to editorialize this however you like, however, what I'm talking about are animal data and yes, human data as well, that show that pain thresholds are increased anytime PAG is activated because of the release of these endogenous opioids. There's also the immediate experience of whether or not a particular form of touch is pleasureful or not. And there there's some very interesting biology that relates to really how those little wires from those DRGs innovate our skin. Work studies I should say done by David Ginty's lab at Harvard Medical School, the Ginty lab has spent years working on the somata sensory system, the touch system has identified a particular category of neurons that innervate the skin and then those neurons of course send that information up to the brain too. And they actually respond to direction of touch. Now, some of you might be more sensitive to this than others, but it turns out that certain hairs like to be deflected one way versus another. Whether you like cats or not, you can do this experiment. You can pet a cat in the direction that they're fur lies. So it lies down in a particular direction. You'll notice that there's actually a gene that dictates that the hairs lie down in a particular direction. And if you pet them in a way that's co-operating with that direction. So not pushing the hairs up, but rather stroking the hairs on the back of the cat. Well, you'll notice as they often like that. Not all cats some cats are pretty grouchy, but if you stroke their hair, they will often per, they'll often push into you. If you were to stroke their hair in the opposite direction, pushing the hairs up against the direction that they want to lie down, cats do not like that. And it turns out that people don't like that either. Some people do like to have their hair pushed in a direction against the direction in which it wants to lay down. But there is more typically response a feeling like it's pleasureful for instance, when someone brushes or combs their hair in the direction that it wants to lay down. And that's because the way in which these neurons, they innovate these hairs sends information up to the brain bifurcates actually, it splits into brain centers that evoke a sense of pleasure or a sense of not pleasure. It's not necessarily pain. So you might find that certain people are very particular. They like to be touched in a certain way, but not others. You might be one of those people. And areas of our skin that have high density of receptors are very, very sensitive in a real way, in a real sense of the word to patterns of touch and whether or not a touch is too firm or too light. And that will be modulated by overall levels of arousal. And when I talk about arousal, what I'm talking about is how alert or how sleep we are. It is impossible to experience pain when we are deep in sleep. I don't mean sleeping like of the typical night's sort. I mean, of the anesthesia sort. That's the purpose of anesthesia to bring the brain and body into a deep plane of rest, very deep in fact, and it's very hard if not impossible to achieve or experience pleasure when we are in a very low state of arousal as well. When we are in heightened states of arousal, we can achieve pain, we can experience pain and we can experience pleasure. And under those heightened states of arousal, we are more sensitive. Literally the passage of electrical signals from those locations on the body that have heightened degrees or higher degrees, I should say of receptors, use your imagination. They include the lips, the face, the feet, and the genitals and nearby areas, literally nearby areas. Under conditions of higher arousal two things happen, the ability to achieve or experience pleasure at those locations goes up and our tolerance and our threshold for pain also goes up. So the principle here is that as our levels of arousal, that foundation of arousal goes up or down, so too goes up and down our ability to achieve pleasure and pain. And so these two extremes of being deep within anesthesia or another extreme as asleep or an heightened levels of arousal, our ability to achieve pleasure and pain are going to scale according to those. And this is why, and I'm certainly not suggesting this, but this is why some people will take stimulants or drugs of abuse that increase arousal in order to achieve pleasure of other kinds. The problem is is that those drugs in particular are things like cocaine and methamphetamine and amphetamine become their own form of reinforcement so much so that the person doesn't seek out any other form of excitement or arousal. So today we weren't talking about addiction. We weren't necessarily talking about motivation, but we touched on those topics as sort of a precursor of what's to come. We talked about the pathways in the skin and in the brain and elsewhere in the body that control our sense of pleasure and pain. We described a number of different tools ranging from hypnosis to different supplements, to electroacupuncture and various other tools that one could use to modulate your sense of pleasure or pain. And of course, in thinking about pleasure, we have to think about the dopamine system and the serotonin system and some of the related chemical systems. I realized that today's podcast had a lot of scientific details. We've timestamped everything for you so that you don't have to digest it all at once of course I don't expect that everyone would be able to understand all these details all at once. What's more important really is to understand the general principles of how something like pleasure and pain work. How they interact, and the very seldom systems within the brain and body that allow them to occur and that modulator or change their ability to occur. And of course your subjective experience of pleasure or pain. So I do hope that this was on hole more pleasureful than painful for you.

    "summary": "The skin is the largest sensory organ and the largest organ in the body. It is an organ that allows us to experience either great pain or great pleasure. The brain needs to make sense of the information from the skin in a multifaceted way. The brain can make predictions based on prior experience, but the pain and pleasure system does not need prior experience. The dermatome is the way in which neurons connect to different parts of the body. The subjective interpretation of what is happening has a profound influence on the experience of pleasure or pain. The range of pain experiences is vast, and the subjective nature of pain and pleasure can have real impact on the treatment of pain. The brain can make predictions about what will happen based on prior experience.

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Eddie Chang. Dr. Eddie Chang is the chair of the neurosurgery department at the University of California at San Francisco. Dr. Chang's clinical group focuses on the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy. He is also a world expert in the treatment of speech disorders and relieving paralysis that prevents speech and other forms of movement and communication. Indeed, his laboratory is credited with discovering ways to allow people who have fully locked-in syndrome, that is, who cannot speak or move, to communicate through computers and AI devices in order to be able to speak to others in their world and understand what others are saying to them. It is a truly remarkable achievement that we discuss today, in addition to his discoveries about critical periods, which are periods of time during one's life when one can learn things, in particular, languages, with great ease as opposed to later in life, and we talk about the basis of things like bilingualism and trilingualism. We talk about how the brain controls movement of the very muscles that allow for speech and language and how those can be modified over time. We also talk about stutter, and we talk about a number of aspects of speech and language that give insight into not just how we create this incredible thing called speech or how we understand speech and language, but how the brain works more generally. Dr. Chang is also one of the world leaders in bioengineering, that is, the creation of devices that allow the brain to function at supraphysiological levels and that can allow people with various syndromes and disorders to overcome their deficits. So if you are somebody who is interested in how the brain works normally, how it breaks down and how it can be repaired, and if you are interested in speech and language, reading and comprehension of information of any kind, today's episode ought to include some information of deep interest to you. Dr. Chang is indeed the top of his field in terms of understanding these issues of how the brain encodes speech and language and creates speech and language and, as I mentioned, movement disorders and epilepsy. We even talk about things such as the ketogenic diet, the future of companies like Neuralink, which are interested in bioengineering and augmenting the human brain, and much more. One thing that I would like to note is that in addition to being a world-class neuroscience researcher and world-class clinician, neurosurgeon, and chair of neurosurgery, Dr. Eddie Chang has also been a close, personal friend of mine since we were nine years old. We attended elementary school together, and we actually had a science club when we were nine years old focused on a very particular topic. You'll have to listen in to today's episode to discover what that topic was and what membership to that club required. That aside, Dr. Chang is an absolute phenom with respect to his scientific prowess, that is, both his research and his clinical abilities, and he's one of these rare individuals that, whenever he opens his mouth, we learn. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Levels. Levels is a program that helps you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. I started using Levels about one year ago. The Levels monitor allowed me to see how different foods change my blood sugar level or my blood glucose level. This turns out to be immensely important for being able to predict how, for instance, certain foods will affect your energy level, your ability to exercise, your ability to recover from exercise, and how it will affect other hormones like testosterone, estrogen, thyroid hormone, and so forth. The other thing about using a Levels monitor is that it gave me insight into how food and exercise and other activities and even how well I was sleeping or how poorly I might happen to be sleeping impact my blood glucose levels. It even taught me that the sauna, that generating a lot of heat in my body, was changing my blood glucose levels, which turned out to inform how I should shift my eating patterns, foods I should eat, timing of eat, and so on and so forth. It really gave me great insight into how all the important aspects of my health were interlocking and affecting one another, not just how food was impacting my blood glucose. So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, you can go to levels.link/huberman. That's levels.link/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover a few months ago, and it is simply incredible. In fact, I don't even like traveling anymore because they don't have Eight Sleep mattress covers in hotels and Airbnbs. One of the reasons I love my Eight Sleep mattress cover so much is that, as you might have heard before on this podcast or elsewhere, in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, you need your body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees, and I tend to run warm at night, which makes it hard to sleep and sometimes wakes me up in the middle of the night. When you sleep on an Eight Sleep mattress cover, you can program the temperature of that mattress cover for specific times in the early, middle, and late part of your night so that the mattress stays cool, and as a consequence, you sleep very, very deeply. It also tracks your sleep, so it's paying attention to how many times you're moving, how deep your sleep is, it gives you a sleep score, all wonderful data to help you enhance your sleep. And of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance, which makes an Eight Sleep a terrific tool for enhancing not just your sleep but all aspects of your life really. If you're interested in trying the Eight Sleep mattress cover, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to check out the Pod 3 cover, and you can save $150 at checkout. Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, to Canada, the UK, and select countries in the EU and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman to save $150 at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed with a quality blood test. One problem with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests, however, is you get data back about levels of metabolic factors, levels of hormones, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that information.

Eddie, welcome. - Hi. Hi, Andrew. - Great to be here with you. This has been a long time coming. Just to come clean, we've known each other since we were nine years old. - Yeah. - But then there was a long gap in which we didn't talk to one another. I heard things about you, and, presumably, you heard a thing or two about me, for better or for worse. [Eddie laughs] And then we reconnected years later when I was a PhD student and you were a medical student. We literally ran into each other in the halls of the University of California San Francisco where you're now the chair of neurosurgery, so it all comes full circle. When you were at UCSF, you were working with Mike Merzenich, and I know that name might not be familiar to a lot of people, but he's sort of synonymous with neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain and nervous system to change in response to experience. So for our listeners, I would just love for you to give a brief overview of what you were doing at that time because I find that work so fascinating, and it really points to some of the things that can promote and maybe hinder our brain's ability to change. - Oh, wow. That's fantastic. So we did bump into each other serendipitously back then, and, at the time, I was a medical student at UCSF studying with Mike Merzenich. In particular, I was studying how the brain organizes when you have patterns of sound. And in particular, we were studying the brain of rodents and trying to understand how different sound patterns organize the frequency representation from low to middle to high frequency maps in the brains of baby rodents. And one of the things that I was very interested in was trying to understand how the patterns of the natural environment, let's say the vocalizations of the environment that the rat pups were raised in, or just the natural sounds that they hear, how that shapes the structure of the brain. And one of the things we did was to try an experiment where we raised some of these rat pups in white noise, continuous white noise that was essentially masking all of those environmental sounds. - And what was the consequence of animals being raised in white noise environment? - Well, one of the things that we didn't expect but we found, which was quite striking, is that there's this early period in brain development where we're very susceptible to the patterns that we hear or see. In neuroscience, we call this a critical period or a sensitive period. And we have this for our eyes, but we also have it for our ears. And one of the most striking examples of this is that any human can essentially grow up in a culture where they hear different speech sounds from one language to another, and it's like after a couple of years, you lose sensitivity to sounds that are not part of your native language and you have high sensitivity for the languages of your native culture. And that's pretty extraordinary that human brain has that flexibility yet, at the same time, has that specialization for language. And so we were trying to think about how do we model this, for example, in rodents, who obviously don't speak, but we're just understanding how sounds and environmental sounds modulate and organize the auditory cortex. And one of the things that we found that was quite striking was that if you basically mask environmental sounds from these rat pups, the critical period, this sensitive period where it's open to plasticity, it's open to change, it's open to reorganization, that window can stay open much, much longer. And in one way, it sounds like that's a good thing, but on the other hand, it's also a retardation. It actually slowed the maturation of the auditory cortex. It was ready to close when these rat pups were really young, but by raising them in white noise, we found out that you could keep it open for months beyond the time period that it normally closes. And so I think one of the things it taught me was that it's not just about the genetic programming that specifies some of this sensitive period, but it's also a little bit about the nature of the sounds that we hear that help keep that window for the critical period open and closed. - That's fascinating. And I know it's difficult to make a direct leap from animal research to human research, but if we could speculate a little bit, I can imagine that some people grow up in homes where there's a lot of shouting and a lot of inflection, maybe people are very verbose. Maybe others grow up in a home where it's quieter and more peaceful. Some people are going to grow up in cities. I just came back from New York City, it's like all night long, there's honking and sirens and it's just nonstop, and then I return here where it's quite quiet at night. Can we imagine that the human brain is going to be shaped differently depending on whether or not one grows up in one environment or another? And would that impact their tendency to speak in a certain way as well as hear in a certain way? What do we know about that? - Well, I think that, from my perspective, it's really clear that those sounds that we are exposed to from the very earliest time, even in utero, in the womb, where the sound is hearing the mother or father or friends while in the womb actually will influence how these things organize. And so there's no question that the sounds that we hear are going to have some influence, and those sounds are going to structure the way that those neural networks actually lay down and will forever influence how you hear sounds, and speech and language is probably one of the most profound examples of that. - I get a lot of questions about the use of white noise during sleep. In particular, people want to know whether or not using a white noise machine or a machine or a program that makes the sound of waves, for instance, if it assists their infant in sleeping, is it going to be bad for them because it's flooding the auditory system with a bunch of essentially white noise or disorganized noise? Do we have an answer to that question? - Not yet. I think that what you're asking is a really important question because parents are using white noise generators almost universally now, and for good reasons. You know, it is hard to have kids up at night. I've got three kids of my own and was very tempted to think about how to use some of these tools to just soothe them and get them to bed, especially when I was, like, so tired and exhausted. But I think that there is a cost, you know, to think a little bit about. You know, we're not exposed to continuous white noise naturally. There is a value to having really salient, structured sounds that are part of our natural environment to actually have the brain develop normally. So whether or not that has an impact, you know, while you're sleeping, it's not clear. I don't think that those studies have been done. What was really clear was that if you raise these baby rats in continuous white noise, not super loud, but just enough to mask the environmental sounds that that was enough to keep, you know, the auditory cortex, the part of the brain that hears, in this really delayed state which could essentially slow down the development and maturation of the brain. - And one could probably assume that slowing the maturation of areas of the brain that are responsible for hearing might, I want to underscore, might impact one's ability to speak, right? Because isn't it the case that if people can't hear, they actually have a harder time enunciating in a particular way, is that right? If I were to not be able to hear my own voice, would my speech patterns change? - Well, I think part of it is that, over time, we develop sensitivity to the very specific speech sounds in a given language, and the sensitivity improves as we hear more and more and more of it. And then on the other hand, we lose sensitivity to other speech sounds at the same time. But as part of that process, we also have a selectivity, a gain, a specialization even for those sounds, even relative to noise, noisy backgrounds and things like that. I tend to think about it like what is the signal-to-noise ratio? And so the brain has its own ways of trying to increase that signal-to-noise ratio in order to make it more clear. Part of that is how we hear and how it lays down a foundation for that signal-to-noise ratio, and so you can imagine a child that's raised continuously in white noise would be really deprived of those kind of sounds that are really necessary for it to develop properly. So I think with regard to those tools for babies, I think we should study it, we should try to understand this definitively. I think what we saw in rodents would tell us that there is potential, you know, things that we should be concerned about. But, again, it's not really clear, if you're just using at night, whether it has those effects. - I guess the critical question that a number of people are going to be asking is did you decide to use a white noise machine or not to help keep any of your three children asleep? - Well, I think the short answer is no. I mean, I obviously did a lot of work thinking and work on this and thought about it carefully, but there are other kinds of noise, or, I wouldn't even call it noise, other sounds that you can use that can be equally soothing to a baby. It's just that white noise has no structure, and what it's doing is essentially masking out all of the natural sounds. And I think the goal should really be about how do we replace that with other more natural sounds that structure the brain in the way that we want to be more healthy. - Well, I know that after you finished your medical training, you went on to, of course, specialize in neurosurgery. And last I checked, you spend most of your days either running your laboratory or in the clinic or running the department, and your clinical work and your laboratory work involves often removing pieces of the skull of humans and going in and either removing things or stimulating neurons, treating various ailments of different kinds, but your main focus these days, of course, is the neurobiology of speech and language. And so for those that aren't familiar, could you please distinguish for us speech versus language in terms of whether or not different brain areas control them? And I know that there's a lot of interest in how speech and language and hearing all relate to one another. And then we'll talk a bit about, for instance, emotions and how facial expressions could play into this, or hand gestures, et cetera. But for the uninformed person, and for me, to be quite direct, what are the brain areas that control speech and language? What are they really, and especially in humans, how are they different? I mean, we have such sophisticated language compared to a number of other species. What does all this landscape look like in there? - Yeah, well, that's a fascinating question, and I'm going to just try to connect a couple of the dots here, which is that in that earlier work during medical school, I was doing a lot of what we call neurophysiology, putting electrodes into the auditory cortex and understanding how the brain responds to sounds, and that's how we actually mapped out these things about the sensitivity to sensitive periods. That experience with Mike Merzenich and thinking about how plasticity is regulated in the brain and particular about how sound is represented by brain activity was something that, you know, was really formative for me. And because I was a medical student and was going back to my medical studies, it was that in combination with seeing some awake brain surgeries that our department is really well known for. One of my mentors, Mitch Berger, really pioneered these methods for taking care of patients with brain tumor and be able to do these surgeries safely by keeping patients awake and by mapping out language. - So they're talking and listening, and you're essentially in conversation with these patients while there's a portion of their skull removed, and you are stimulating or, in some cases, removing areas of their brain, is that right? - That's exactly right, and the only thing off there is it's not essentially, it is just that. The only difference between the conversation that I might have with my patient who's undergoing awake brain surgery is that I can't see their face and they can't see my face. We actually have a sterile drape that actually separates the operating field, and they're looking and interacting with our neuropsychologist, but I can talk to them and they can hear my voice and vice versa. And it's a really, really important way of how we can protect some of those areas that are really critical for language, at the same time, accomplish a mission of getting the seizures under control or getting a brain tumor removed. - And is that because occasionally you'll encounter a brain area, maybe you're stimulating or considering removing that brain area, and suddenly a patient will start stuttering or will have a hard time formulating a sentence? Is that essentially what you're looking for? You're looking for regions in which it is okay or not okay to probe? - Exactly, so the first thing that we do is that we use a small electrical stimulator to probe different parts of the areas that we think might be related and important for language or talking or even movements of your arm and leg. That's what we call brain mapping. And we use a small electrical current that's delivered through a probe that we can just put at each spot. And the areas that we're really interested in are, of course, the areas that are right around the part that is pathological, the part that's injured, or the part that has a brain tumor that we want to remove, so we can apply that probe and transiently, meaning temporarily, activate it. So if you're stimulating the part of the brain that controls the hand, the hand will move, it will jerk. Sometimes a fist will be made, something like that. Other times, while someone is counting or just saying the days of the week, you can stimulate in a different area that stops their speech altogether. That's what we call speech arrest. Or if someone is looking at pictures and they're describing the pictures and you stimulate in a particular area, they stop speaking or the words start coming out slurred or they can't remember the name of the object that they're seeing in the picture. These are all things that we're listening really carefully while we apply that focal stimulation. That's what we call brain mapping. - What are some of the more surprising, or maybe even if you want to offer one of the more outrageous examples of things that people have suddenly done or failed to be able to do as a consequence of this brain mapping? - Well, I think the thing to me that has been the most striking is that, you know, some of these areas you stimulate, and altogether, you can shut down someone's talking. So a person says, \"I wanted to say it, but I couldn't get the words out.\" And even though I've seen this thousands of times now, it's still exciting every time that I see it because, it's exciting because you're seeing the brain, it's a physical organ, it's part of the body, outside of the veins on top of it, it doesn't look like a machine. But when you do something like that and you focally change the way it works, and you see that because the person can't talk anymore and they say, \"I know what I want to say, but I couldn't get the words out,\" you're confronted with this idea that that organ is the basis of speech and language and way beyond that, obviously, you know, for all the other functions that we have for thinking and feeling our emotions, everything. So that, to me, is a constant reminder of, you know, this really special thing that the brain does which is compute so many of the things that we do, and in particular in the area around speech and language, generating words, something that is really unique to our species, is just extraordinary to see. Again, even though I've seen it thousands of times, it's just having that connection because it doesn't look like a machine, but it is doing something that is quite complicated, precise, and remarkable. - Do you ever see emotional responses from stimulation in particular areas? And do you ever hear or see emotional responses that are associated with particular types of speech? Because, for instance, curse words are known to, people with Tourette's often will curse, not always, sometimes they'll have tics or other things. But what I learned from a colleague of ours is that curse words have a certain structure to them. There's usually a heavy or kind of a sharp consonant up front, right, that allows people, at least as it was described to me, to have some sort of emotional release. It's not a word like murmur, which has kind of a soft entry here, I'm not using the technical language, and you pick your favorite curse word out there, folks. I'm not going to shout out any now or say any now, but that certain words have a structure to them that, because of the motor patterns that are involved in saying that word, you could imagine it has an emotional response unto itself. So when stimulating or when blocking these different brain areas, do you ever see people get angry or sad or happy or more relaxed? - Oh, well, definitely I've seen cases where you can invoke anxiety, stress, and I think that there are also areas that you can stimulate and you can also evoke the opposite of that, sort of like a calm state. - I think that brain area is slightly hyperactive in you, or at least more than me. In all the years I've known you, you've always been, at least externally, a very calm person. I mean, I always find it amusing that you work on speech and language and you have a very calming voice. And I'm being really serious. I think that there's a huge variation in that, right, in terms of how people speak and how they accent words. - Absolutely, yeah. So there are areas, for example, the orbitofrontal cortex that we showed that if you stimulate there... The orbitofrontal cortex is a part of the brain that's above the eyes. That's why they call it orbitofrontal, meaning it's above the eye or the orbit and in the frontal lobe, and it's this area right in here. It has really complex functions. It's really important for learning and memory. But one of the things that we observed is when you stimulate in there, people tended to have a reduction in their stress, and it was very much related to their state of being, meaning that if someone was already kind of feeling normal and you stimulate there, it didn't do much. But if someone was in a very anxious state, it actually relieved that. And then we've seen the corollary of that which is true, too, which is that there are other areas like the amygdala or parts of the insula that if you stimulate, you can cause an acute temporary anxiety, a nervous feeling, or if you stimulate the insula, people can have an acute feeling of disgust. So, you know, the brain has different functions and these different nodes that help process the way we feel. Certainly, I think that, to some degree, neuropsychiatric conditions reflect an imbalance of the electrical activities in these areas. One of the things that was something I will never forget was taking care of a young woman with uncontrolled seizures. We call that epilepsy. It's a medical condition where someone has uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. Sometimes you can see that as convulsions where people are shaking and lose consciousness. There are other kind of seizures that people can have where they don't lose consciousness, but they can have experiences that just come out of nowhere just as a result of electrical activity coming from the brain. And about six years ago, I took care of a young woman who was diagnosed psychiatrically with anxiety disorder for several years. It turns out that it wasn't really an anxiety disorder. It was actually that she had underlying seizures, an epilepsy activating a part of her brain that evokes, you know, anxious feelings. - How was that discovered? Because I know a lot of people out there have anxiety. I mean, in the absence of a brain scan, how or why would one suspect that maybe they have a tumor or some other condition that was causing those neurons to become hyperactive? - Yeah, that's really important because so many people have anxiety, and the vast, vast majority are not having that because they're having seizures in the brain. I think one of the ways that this was diagnosed was that the nature of when she was having these panic attacks was not triggered by anything. They would just happen spontaneously. And that's what can happen with seizures sometimes. They just come out of nowhere. We don't fully understand what can trigger them, but they weren't things that were typically anxiety-provoking. This is something that just happened all of a sudden. And because you brought it up, this is not something that you can see on an MRI. We could not see and look at the structure of her brain, with an MRI, that she was having seizures. The only way that we could actually prove this was actually putting electrodes into her brain and proving that these attacks that she was having were localized to a part called the amygdala, it's a medial part of the temporal lobe, which is here, and associating the electrical activity that we were seeing on those electrodes with the symptoms that she had, and she ultimately needed a kind of surgery where she was awake in order to remove this safely. - Speaking of epilepsy, a number of people out there have epilepsy or know people who do. Are the drugs for epilepsy satisfactory? You know, I think about things like Depakote, you know, and adjusting the excitation and inhibition of the brain. I mean, are there good drugs for epilepsy? We know there are not great drugs for a lot of other conditions. And how often does one need neurosurgery in order to treat epilepsy? Or can it be treated most often just using pharmacology? - Yeah, great question. Well, a lot of people have seizures that can be completely controlled by their medications, a lot. But there's about a one-third of people who have epilepsy, which we define as anyone who's had three or more seizures that, you know, about a third of them actually don't have control with all of the modern medications that we have nowadays. And some of the data suggests that if you have two or three medications, it actually doesn't matter necessarily which of the anti-seizure medications it is, but there is data suggests if you've just tried two or three, the fourth, fifth, sixth, and beyond is not likely to help control it. So we are in a situation, unfortunately, where a lot of the medications are great for some people, but for another subset, they can't control it, and it comes from a particular part of the brain. Now, fortunately, in that subset, there's another part of that group that can benefit from a surgery that actually either removes that part of the brain, and nowadays, we'll use stimulators now to sometimes put electrical stimulation in that part of the brain to help reduce the seizures. - And you said a third of people with epilepsy might need neurosurgery? - Well, what I mean by that is, like, they continue to have seizures that are not controlled by all medications, and there's going to be another subset of those that may benefit from a surgery. It's probably not that whole third, it's a subset of that. It's just to say that epilepsy can be really hard to get fixed. And for people where the seizures come from one spot or, you know, an area, then surgery can do great. If it comes from multiple areas or if it comes from the whole brain, then we have to think about other methods to control it. Fortunately, nowadays, there's actually other ways. Surgery now, to us, doesn't just mean removing part of the brain. Half of what we do now is use stimulators that modulate the state of the brain that can help reduce the seizures. - I've heard before that the ketogenic diet was originally formulated in order to treat epilepsy and, in particular, in kids. Is that true, and why would being in a ketogenic state with low blood glucose reduce seizures? - That's a great question. And to be honest, I don't know actually if it was originally designed to treat seizures, but I can tell you for sure that for some people, just like with some medications, it can be a life-changing thing. It can completely change the way that the brain works. And it's not something that's for everybody, but for some people, there's no question, and it has some very beneficial effects. I think it's to be determined still, like why and how that works. - I've heard similar things about the ketogenic diet for people with Alzheimer's dementia, that there's nothing particularly relevant about ketosis to Alzheimer's per se, but because Alzheimer's changes the way that neurons metabolize energy that shifting to an alternate fuel source can sometimes make people feel better, and so a number of people are now trying it. But it's not as if blood glucose and having carbohydrates is causing Alzheimer's. And people get confused often that just because something can help doesn't mean that the opposite is harming somebody. So I find this really interesting. Sometime I'll check back with you about what's happening in terms of ketogenic diets and epilepsy. But you said that in some cases, it can help. Has that observation been made both for children and for adults? Because I thought that, originally, the ketogenic diet for epilepsy was really for pediatric epilepsy. - Yeah, that's right. So a lot of its focus has really been on kids with epilepsy, but certainly it's a safe thing to try, so a lot of adults, you know, will try it as well. - Interesting. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day, is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health, and those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of Vitamin D3+K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of Vitamin D3+K2. I'm curious about epilepsy for another reason. I was taught that epilepsy is an imbalance in the excitation and inhibition in the brain. So you think about these electrical storms that give people either grand mal, you know, shaking and kind of convulsions. But years ago, I was reading a book, a wonderful book actually, called \"Einstein in Love\" by Dennis Overbye. It was about Einstein and I guess his personal life. People who knew him claimed that he would sometimes walk along, and then every once in a while would just stop and kind of stare off into space for anywhere from a minute to three to five minutes, and it was speculated that he had absence seizures. What is an absence seizure? And the reason I ask is I occasionally will be walking along and I'll be thinking about something and I'll stop. But in my mind, I'm thinking during that time, but I realize that if I were to see myself from the outside, it might appear that I was just kind of absent. What is an absence seizure? Because it's so strikingly different in its description from, say, a grand mal convulsive seizure. - Sure, well, like I mentioned before, depending on how the seizure activity spreads in the brain or how it actually propagates, if it stays in one particular spot and doesn't spread to the entire brain, it can have really different manifestation. It can represent really differently. So absence seizure is just one category of different kind of seizures where you can lose consciousness basically, and what I mean by that is that you're not fully aware of what's going on in your environment, okay? So you're sort of taken offline temporarily from consciousness, but you could still be, for example, standing, and to people who are not paying attention, they may not even be aware that that's happening. - What are some other types of seizures? - Well, you know, I think some of the other kinds, the classic ones are temporal lobe seizures. So these are ones that come from the medial structures like the amygdala and hippocampus. Oftentimes people, when they have seizures coming from that, they may taste something very unusual like a metallic taste or smell something like the smell of burning toast, something like that. There are some people, with temporal lobe seizures, will have deja vu. They will have that experience that you've been somewhere before, but that's just a precursor to the seizure. And it just highlights that when people have seizures coming from these areas, they sometimes hijack what that part of the brain is really for. So the amygdala and hippocampus, for example, are really important for learning and memory. It's not surprising that when people have seizures there that it can evoke a feeling of deja vu or that it can evoke a feeling of anxiety. And the areas that are right next to it, for example, these areas are really important for processing smell. So these areas are right next to each other so you can have these kind of complex set of symptoms, the weird taste, the smell of toast, and then a feeling of deja vu, that's classic for a temporal lobe seizure, and it's because those parts of the brain that process those functions are right next to each other. - I'm told that I've had nocturnal seizures, and I've woken up sometimes from sleep having felt as if I was having a convulsion, the sort of sense of buzzing in the back of the head. This happened to me two or three times in college. Well, I woke up and my girlfriend was very distraught, like, \"You were having a seizure.\" I was having full convulsion in my sleep. Is that correct? Is there such a thing as nocturnal seizures? What do they reflect? They eventually stopped happening, and I couldn't tether them to any kind of life event. I wasn't doing any kind of combat sport or anything at the time, I wasn't drinking alcohol much, it's never really been my thing. What are nocturnal seizures about? - [Eddie] Oh, well- - And do I need brain surgery? [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Nocturnal seizures are just another form. Like, again, epilepsy and seizures can have so many different forms and not just, like, where in the brain, but also when they happen. And there are some people who, for whatever reason, it's very timed to the circadian rhythm. It's actually not just happening at night, but a certain period at night when people are in a certain stage of sleep that the brain is in a state that it's vulnerable to having a seizure, and so that's basically just one form of that. Again, it's not just about where it's coming from, but also when it's happening and how that's timed with other things that are happening with the body. - Interesting. Well, it eventually stopped happening so I stopped worrying about it. I haven't had seizures since. Returning to speech and language, when I was getting weaned in neuroscience, I learned that we have an area of the brain for producing speech and we have an area of the brain for comprehending speech. What's the story there? Is it still true that we have a Broca's and a Wernicke's area? Those are names of neurologists, presumably, or neurosurgeons that discovered these different brain areas. Maybe you could familiarize us with some of the sort of textbook version of how speech and language are organized in the brain, maybe share with us a little bit of the lesion studies that led to that understanding, and then I would love to hear a bit about what your laboratory is discovering about how things are actually organized, because from some discussions you and I have had over the last year or so, it seems like, well, let's just be blunt, it seems that much of what we know from the textbooks could be wrong. - Well, I love that question because, for me, it's very central to the research we do, and it's where the intersection between what we do in the laboratory in our research interfaces with what I see in patients. And one of the things that fascinated me early on in my medical training was in doing some of these brain mapping or watching them with my mentor or taking care of patients that had, you know, brain tumors in a certain part of the brain was that, a lot of times, what I was seeing in a patient did not correlate with what I was taught in medical school. And, you know, some people will think, well, this might be an exception, but after you see it for a couple times and if you're kind of interested in this problem, you know, it poses a serious challenge to what you've learned and how you think about how these things operate. And that actually got me really interested in trying to figure this out because, earlier, we talked about just this extraordinary thing that the brain is doing to create words and sentences, and that's the process by which I'm getting ideas out from my mind into yours. It's an incredible thing, right? It's the basis of communication, high information communication between two individuals that's really unique to humans. So in historical times, how this works has been very controversial from day one of neuroscience. A long time ago, people thought the bumps on your head corresponded to the different faculties of the mind. So for example, if you had a bump here, it might be corresponding to intelligence or another one over here, you know, to vision and these kind of things. That's what we nowadays call phrenology, and that was kind of the starting point. A lot of that has been, of course, debunked, but when you see those little statues of different brain partitions on someone's head, that's essentially how people were thinking about how the brain worked back then, a couple hundred years ago. Modern neuroscience began when, actually, it was very much related to the discovery of language. So modern neuroscience, meaning moving beyond this idea that the bumps on the scalp corresponded to the faculties of the mind, but there were things that actually were in the brain themselves, and they weren't corresponding to things that you could see superficially, like on the scalp or externally, that it was something about the brain itself. I mean, it seems so obvious now, but back then, this was the big academic, you know, debate. And the first observation that I think was really impactful in the area of language was an observation by a French neurosurgeon named Pierre Broca. And what he observed was that in a patient, not that he did surgery in, but that he had seen and taken care of, that the person couldn't talk. And, in particular, they called this individual Tan because the only words that he could produce was tan, tan. For the most part, he could generally understand the kind of things that people were asking him about, but the only thing that he could utter from his mouth were these words, tan, tan. And what eventually had happened was this individual passed away, and the way that neuroscience was done back then was basically to wait until that happened and then to remove the brain and to see what part of the brain was affected in this patient that they called Tan. And what Broca found was that there was a part in the left frontal lobe, so the frontal lobe is this area like I described earlier, which is, you know, up behind our forehead, up here, and in the back of that frontal lobe, he claimed that this was the seat of articulation in the brain. He literally used something like that in French, the seat of articulation, meaning that this is the part of the brain that is responsible for us to generate words. About 50 years later, the story becomes more complicated with a German neurologist named Carl Wernicke. And what Wernicke described was a different set of symptoms in patients that he observed a different phenomenon where people could produce words, but a lot of the words, and they were fluent in the sense that, like, they sound like they could be real words but from a different language, for example. And some of us call that, like, word salad or jargon. They were essentially making up words, but it was not intentional. It was just the way that the words came out. But in addition to that, he observed that these people also could not understand what was being said to them. So we could be having a conversation, and I'd be asking you, \"Am I a woman?\" And you might nod your head, you know, just because you're not processing the question. And so here are two observations. One is that the frontal lobe is important for articulating speech, creating the words and expressing them fluently. And then a different part of the brain called the left temporal lobe, which is this area right above my ear, that is an area that I think was claimed to be really important for understanding. So the two major functions in language, to speak and to understand, were kind of pinned down to that, and we've had that basic idea in the textbooks for, you know, over 200 years. - It's certainly what I was taught. - [Eddie] Is that right? - Oh, yeah, and certainly what we still, we still teach undergraduates, graduate students, and medical students that. - Well, that's what I learned, too, in medical school. And what I saw in reality when I started taking care of patients was that it's not so simple. In fact, part of it is fundamentally wrong. So just in a nutshell, nowadays, after, you know, looking at this very carefully over hundreds of patients, we've shown that surgeries, for example, in the posterior part of the frontal lobe, a lot of times, people have no problem talking at all whatsoever after those kind of surgeries, and that it's a different part of the brain that we call the precentral gyrus. The precentral gyrus is a part of the brain that is intimately associated with the motor cortex. The motor cortex is the part of the brain that has a map of your entire body so that it has a part that corresponds to your feet, it has a part that corresponds to your hands. But then there's another part that comes out more laterally on the side of the brain that corresponds to your lips, your jaw, your larynx, and we have seen that when patients have surgeries or injuries to that part of the brain, it actually can really interrupt language, so it's not as simple as just moving the muscles of the vocal tract, but it's also important for formulating and expressing words. So that's Broca's area that I think the field now recognizes not just because of our work, but many other people that have studied this in stroke and beyond, is that the idea that that is the basis of speaking in Broca's area is fundamentally wrong right now, and we have to figure out how to correct the textbooks that we kind of understand that so that we can continue to make progress. Now, in terms of the other major area that we call Wernicke's area in the posterior temporal lobe, that has held, I think, quite legitimately for some time. So that is an area that you have to be super careful when you do surgery there. That's an area where, if you have a mistake there and you cause a stroke or you remove too much of the tumor there, you go too far beyond it, then the person can be really, really hurt. Like, they'll have a condition that we call aphasia where they may not be able to understand words, they may not be able to remember the word that they're trying to say. They know what they're trying to say, but they can't remember the precise word that goes with the object that they're trying to think of. They may even produce words that I described before are like word salad or very jargony. So, you know, they might say something like tamiranai. That's not a real word, but it sounds like it could be, you know? And that's just because that part of the brain has some role not just in understanding what we hear, but also actually has a really important role in sending the commands to different parts of the brain to control what we say. - Not long ago, you and me and my good friend Rick Rubin were having a conversation about medicine and science, and Rick asked the question, \"What percentage of what you learned in graduate and/or medical school do you think is correct?\" And you had a very interesting answer. Would you share it with us? - I don't know. I don't remember the exact. But I would say that with regard to the brain in particular, I would say about 50% gets it right and accurate and is helpful, but another 50% is just the approximation and oversimplification of what's going on. The example that we talked about, language is just an example of that. It's just there are things that make it easier to learn and easier to teach and easier to even think about, and that's probably why we continue teaching in the way that we do. But I think as time goes on, the complexity of reality of how the brain works is, well, first of all, we're still trying to figure it out, and second of all, it is complex and it's still incomplete story. - It's early days. And we'll get into some of the technical advances that are allowing some correction of the errors that the field has made. And, look, no disrespect to the brain explorers that came before us, and the ones that come after us will correct us, right? That's the way the game is played. But what I'm hearing is that there are certain truths that people accept, and then there's about half of the information that is still open for debate and maybe even for complete revision. One thing that I learned about language and the neural circuits underlying language is that it's heavily lateralized, that these structures, Broca's and Wernicke's and other structures in the brain responsible for speech and comprehension of speech sit mainly on one side of the brain, but they do not have a mirror representation or another equivalent area on the opposite side of the brain. And for those that haven't poked around in a lot of brains, certainly you, Eddie, have done far more of that than I have, but I've done my fair share in nonhuman species and a little bit in humans, almost every structure, almost every structure has a matching structure on the other side of the brain, so when we say the hippocampus, we really mean two hippocampi, one on each side of the brain. But language, I was taught, is heavily lateralized, that is, that there's only one. So that raises two questions. One, is that true? And if it is true, then what is the equivalent real estate on the opposite side of the brain doing if it's not doing the same function that the one on, say, the left side is performing? - Well, that's one of those things that is, again, like mostly true, not 100%. And what I mean by that is that it's complicated. So for people who are right-handed, 99% of the time, the language part of the brain is on the left side. - And what is the equivalent brain area on the right side doing if it's not doing language? - Well, you know, the thing that's incredible is if you look at the right side and you look at it very carefully, either under an MRI or you actually look at the brain under slides in a microscope, it looks very, very similar. It's not identical, but it looks very, very similar. All the gyri, which are the bumps on the brain that, you know, have the different contours and the valleys that we call sulci, those all look basically the same. Like, there is a mirror anatomy on the left and right side, and so it's not been so clear what's so special actually about the left side to house language. But what we do know, and this is what we use all the time in assessing and figuring out, you know, this before surgery, is if you're right-handed, 99% of the time, the language is going to be on the left side of the brain. - Is handedness genetic in any way? I mean, when I grew up, - Yes. - a pen or a pencil or crayon was placed into my hand presumably, or I started using... My father was left-handed, and then where he grew up in South America, they forced him to force himself to become right-handed. They actually used to restrict the movement of his left hand so he was forced to write... And then you have hook lefties and hook righties. And I know this is a deep dive and we probably don't want to go into every derivation of this, but so for somebody who's left-handed, naturally just starts writing with the left hand, there's some genetic predisposition to being left-handed? - Absolutely. No question about it. Handedness is not entirely but strongly genetic. So there is something that ties all of this, and what does handedness, for example, have to do with the part of your brain that controls language? Well, it turns out that the parts that control the hand are very close to the areas that really are responsible for the vocal tract. Again, part of the motor cortex and part of this brain area called the precentral gyrus. And there are some theories that, because of their proximity, that these parts of the brain might develop together early in utero and they might have a head start compared to the right side, and because they have a head start that things solidify there. This is one theory of why this happens. In people who are left-handed, it still turns out that the vast majority of people have language on the left side, but it's not 99%, it's more like 70%. So if you're left-handed, it's still more likely that the language part of your brain is going to be on the left side, but there's going to be a greater proportion, maybe 20, 30%, where it's either in both hemispheres or on the right side. And just to make this a little bit more interesting is that when people have strokes on the left side, and if they are lucky enough to recover from those strokes, sometimes that involves reorganization, this term that we call plasticity earlier, where the areas around where the stroke take on that new function in a way that they didn't have before. That can certainly happen in the left hemisphere, but there are also instances where the right hemisphere can also start to take on the function of language where it was once on left and then transfers to the right. So the thing that I think about a lot is that the machinery probably exists on both sides, but we don't use them together all the time. In fact, we may strongly bias one side or the other. Just like we use our two hands in very, very different ways, it's a little bit the same with the brain. Well, it's because of what we do with the brain that actually is why we use the hands in different ways. And the same thing goes for language, which is that, again, the substrates, the organ, the language organ, the part of the brain that process it probably has very similar machinery on the left side as the right, and the right may have the capability to do it, but in real, everyday use, the brain specializes one of the sides in order for us to use it functionally. That's a theory. - You're bilingual, correct? - Yeah. - [Andrew] You speak English and Chinese? - Yeah. - For people that are bilingual and that learn two or more, well, bilingual is two, obviously, but learn both languages or let's say more languages from an early time in life, do they use the same brain area to generate that language? Or perhaps they use the left side to speak English and the right side to speak Chinese? Do we know anything about bilingualism in the brain? - Well, I think we know a lot about bilingualism in the brain. The answers are still out there, the final answers on it, and part of the answer is yes, absolutely, we use some parts of the brain very similarly. We actually have a study in the lab right now where we're looking at this where people who speak one language or another or are bilingual, and we're looking at how the brain activity patterns occur when they're hearing one language versus the other. And what's striking to see, actually, is how overlapping they really can be. Even though the person may have no idea of the language that they're hearing, the English part of the brain is still processing that and maybe trying to interpret it through an English lens, for example. So the short answer is that with bilingualism, there are shared circuitry, there's this shared machinery in the brain that allows us to process both, but it's not identical. It's the same part of the brain, but what it's doing with the signals can be very, very different. And what I mean by that precisely is not the instantaneous detecting of one sound to the next, but the memory of the sequences of those particular sounds that give rise to things like words and meaning, that can be highly variable from one individual to the next, and those neurons are very, very sensitive to the sequences of the sounds, even though the sounds themselves might have some overlap between languages. - Fascinating. Okay, so we've talked about brain areas and a little bit about lateralization. I want to get back to the hands and some things related to emotion in a little bit. But maybe now we could go into those brain areas and start to ask the question, what exactly is represented or mapped there? And for people who perhaps aren't familiar with brain mapping and representation and receptive fields, perhaps the simplest analogy might be the visual system where I look at your face, I know you, I recognize you, and certainly there are brain areas that are responsible for face recognition. But the fact that I know that that's your face, and for those listening, I'm looking into Eddie's face, the fact that I know that that's your face at all is because we are well aware that there are cells that represent edges and that represent dark and light, and those all combine in what we call a hierarchical structure. They sort of build up from basic elements as simple as little dots, but then lines and things that move, et cetera, to give a coherent representation of the face. When I think about language, I think about words and just talking. If I sit down and do a long podcast or I think about asking you a question, I don't even think about the words I want to say very much. I mean, I have to think about them a little bit, one would hope, but I don't think about individual syllables unless I'm trying to, you know, accent something or it's a word that I have a particular difficulty saying or I want to change the cadence, et cetera. So what's represented in the neurons, the nerve cells in these areas? Are they representing vowels, consonants? And how do things like inflection... Like I occasionally will poke fun at upspeak, but there's, I think, a healthy, a normal version of upspeak where somebody's asking a question, like, for instance, what is that? That's an appropriate use of upspeak as opposed to saying something that is not a question and putting a lilt at the end of the sentence, then we call that upspeak, which doesn't fit with what the person is saying. So what in the world is contained in these brain areas, what is represented, to me, is perhaps one of the most interesting questions, and I know this lands square in your wheelhouse. - Sure, let's get into this, Andrew, because this is one of the most exciting stuff that's happening right now is understanding how the brain processes these exact questions. And you asked me earlier, you know, what is difference between speech and language? Speech corresponds to the communication signal. It corresponds to me moving my mouth and my vocal tract to generate words, and you're hearing these as an auditory signal. Language is something much broader. So it refers to what you're extracting from the words that I'm saying, we call that pragmatics and sort of are you getting the gist of what I'm saying? There's another aspect of it that we call semantics. Do you understand the meaning of these words and the sentences? There's another part that we call syntax, which refers to how the words are assembled in a grammatical form. So those are all really critical parts of language, and speech is just one form of language. There's many other forms like sign language, reading. Those are all important modalities for reading. Our research really focuses on this area that we're calling speech, again, the production of this audio signal which you can't see but your microphones are picking up. There are these vibrations in the air that are created by my vocal tract that are picked up by the microphone in the case of this recording, but also picked up by the sensors in your ear. The very tiny vibrations in your ear are picking that up and translating that into electrical activity. And what the ear does at the periphery is translates all sounds into different frequencies. So its main thing to do is to take a speech signal or any other kind of sound and decompose it, meaning separate that sound into different kind of signals. And in the case of hearing, what it's doing is separating it out into low, middle, high frequencies at a very, very high resolution. It's doing it very quickly, and it's doing it in a really fine way to separate all of those different sounds. So if you look at the periphery near the nerve that goes to your ear, those nerve fibers, some of them are tuned to low frequencies, some of them are tuned to high frequencies, some of them are tuned to the middle frequencies, and that is what your ear is doing. It's taking these words and splitting them up into different frequencies. - And for those of you out there that aren't familiar with thinking about things in the so-called frequency space, bass tones would be lower frequencies and high-pitched tones would be higher frequencies, just to make sure everyone's on the same page. So the sound of my voice, the sound of your voice, or any sound in the environment is being broken down into these frequencies. Are they being broken down into very narrow channels of frequency, or are they, I want to avoid nomenclature here, or are they being binned as fairly broad frequencies? 'Cause we know low, medium, and high, but, for instance, I can detect whether or not something's approaching me or moving away from me depending on whether or not it sweeps louder [imitates sound approaching] or [imitates sound receding], right, towards or away. It's subtle, and of course it's combined with what I see and my own movement, But how finely sliced is our perception of the auditory world? - Oh, extraordinarily precise. I mean, we take these millisecond cues, the millisecond differences between the sound coming to one ear, let's say your right ear versus your left, to understand what direction that sound came from. Those are only millisecond differences, and that's how precise this works. But on the other hand, it does a lot of computation on this it does a lot of analysis as you go up, and a lot of our work is focused on the part of the brain that we call the cortex. The cortex is the outermost part of brain where we believe that sounds are actually converted into words and language. So there's this transformation where, at the ear, words are decomposed and turned into these elemental frequency channels, and then as it goes up through the auditory system, hits the cortex. There are some things that happen obviously before it gets to the cortex, but when it gets to cortex, there's something special going on, which is that that part of the brain is looking for specific sounds. And specifically what I mean by that is the sounds of human language, so the ones that are the different consonants and vowels in a different language. One of the ways that we have studied this is looking in patients who have epilepsy. And in a lot of these cases where the MRI looks completely normal, we have to put electrodes surgically on a part of the brain. The temporal lobe is a very, very common place, so we've done a lot of our work looking at how the temporal lobe processes speech sounds because we're looking for where the seizures start, but then we're also doing brain mapping for language and speech so we can protect those areas. We want to identify the areas that we want to remove to cure someone's seizures, but we also want to figure out the areas that are important for speech and language to protect those so that we can do a surgery that's effective and safe. And so in our research, and why it's become a really important addition to our knowledge is that we have electrodes directly recording from the human brain surface. A lot of the technology we work with right now is recording on the order of millimeters, and they can record millisecond time resolution of neural activity, and what we see is extraordinary patterns of activity when people hear words and sentences. If you look at that part of the brain that we call Wernicke's area in this part of the temporal lobe, this whole area lights up when you hear words or speech. And it's not in a way that is like a general light bulb warming up and it's generally lit up, but what you actually see is something much, much more complicated, which is a pattern of activity, and what we've done in the last 10 years is try to understand what does that pattern come from? And if we were to look at each individual site from that part of the brain, what would we see? What parts of words are being coded by electrical activity in those parts of the brain? Remember, the cortex is using electrical activity to transmit information and do analysis, and what we're doing is we're eavesdropping on this part of the brain as it's processing speech to try to understand what each individual site is doing. - And what are those sites doing, or could you give us some examples of what those sites are doing? So, for instance, are they sites that are specific for, or we could say even listening for consonants or for vowels or for inflection or for emotionality? What's in there? - [Eddie] Okay, well- - What makes these, what makes these cells fire? - Yeah, what gets them excited? - Yeah. - What gets them going is hearing speech. In particular, there are some of these really focal sites, again, just on the order of millimeter or, at some level, single neurons that are tuned to consonants, some are tuned to vowels, some are tuned to particular features of consonants. What I mean by that are different categories of consonants. There's a class of consonants that we call plosive consonants. This is a little bit of linguistic jargon, but I'm going to make a point here with that is that certain classes of sounds, when you make them, it requires you to actually close your mouth temporarily. - Hmm. Now I'm going to be thinking about this. So plosive, like plosive, like saying the word plosive requires that. - Exactly, so what's cool about that is that we actually have no idea what's going on in our mouth when we speak. We really have no idea. - Some people definitely have no idea. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Well, not just like in terms of what you're saying sometimes, but actually like how you're actually moving, you know, the different parts of vocal tract. And I have a feeling if we actually required understanding, we would never be able to speak 'cause it's so complex. It's such a complex feat. Some people would say it's the most complex motor thing that we do as a species is just speaking. Not, you know, the extreme feats of acrobatics or athleticism but speaking. - And especially when one observes, you know, opera or people who, you know, freestyle rappers. And of course it's not just the lips. It's the tongue. And you've mentioned two other structures Pharynx and larynx are the main ones. Can you tell us, just educate us at a superficial level what the pharynx and larynx do differentially? 'Cause I think most people aren't going to be familiar with that. - Okay, sure. So I'll talk primarily about the larynx here for a second, which is that if you think about when we're speaking, really, what we're doing is we're shaping the breath. So even before you get to the larynx, you got to start with the expiration. So we fill up our lungs and then we push the air out. That's a normal part of breathing. And what is really amazing about speech and language is that we evolved to take advantage of that normal physiologic thing, add a larynx, and what the larynx does is that when you're exhaling, it brings the vocal folds together. Some people call them vocal cords. They're not really cords. They're really vocal folds. They're two pieces of tissue that come together, and a muscle brings them together. And then what happens is when the air comes through the vocal folds when they're together, they vibrate at really high frequencies, like 100 to 200 hertz. Yours is probably about 100 hertz. The average- - Whereas yours is 200. [Andrew laughs] - No, no. Most male voices are around 100, okay? And then the average female voice around 200 hertz. - Well, and as you know, I've always had the same voice. - Yes, yes, the same- - This was a point of shame when I was a kid. Folks, my voice never changed. I always had the same voice. This is a discussion for another time. - Yeah, well, it's a great voice, you know, a great baritone voice, but I know in your voice, it's a low-frequency voice. And the reason why men and women generally have different voice qualities is it has to do with the size of the larynx and the shape of it, okay? So in general, men have a larger voice box or larynx, and the vibrating frequency, the resonance frequency of the vocal folds when the air comes through them is about 100 hertz for men and about 200 for women. So what happens is, okay, so you take a breath in, and then as the air is coming out, the vocal folds come together and the air goes through. That creates the sound of the voice that we call voicing, and that's the energy of your voice. It's not just your voice characteristic, it's the energy of your voice. It's coming from the larynx there, it's a noise. And then it's the source of the voice. And then what happens is that energy, that sound goes up through the parts of the vocal tract, like the pharynx into the oral cavity, which is your mouth and your tongue and your lips. And what those things are doing is that they're shaping the air in particular ways that create consonants and vowels. So that's what I mean by shaping the breath. It just starts with this exhalation. You generate the voice in the larynx, and then everything above the larynx is moving around, just like the way my mouth is doing right now, to shape that air into particular patterns that you can hear as words. - Fascinating, and immediately makes me wonder about more primitive or non-learned vocalizations like crying or laughter. Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. Are those sorts of vocalizations produced by the language areas like Wernicke's, or do they have their own unique neural structures? - Yeah, interesting question. So we call those vocalizations. A vocalization is basically where someone can create a sound, like a cry or a moan, that kind of sound, and it also involves the exhalation of air. It also involves some phonation at the level larynx where the vocal folds come together to create that audible sound. But it turns out that those are actually different areas, so people who have injuries in the speech and language areas oftentimes can still moan, they can still vocalize, and it is a different part of the brain, I would say an area that even nonhuman primates have that can be specialized, you know, for vocalization. It's a different form of communication than words, for example. - The intricacy of these circuits in the brain and their connections to the pharynx and larynx is just, it's almost overwhelming in terms of thinking about just how complicated it must be, and yet some general features and principles are starting to emerge from your work and from the work of others. If we think about that work and we think about, for instance, Wernicke's area, if I were to record from neurons in Wernicke's area at different locations, would I find that there's any kind of systematic layout? For instance, in terms of, you talked about sound frequency, we know that low frequencies are represented at one end of a structure and high frequencies at the other. This is true actually, at least from my earlier training, within the ear itself, within the cochlea, the early work of von Bekesy and from cadavers, right? They actually figured this out from dead people, which is incredible. A fascinating literature people should look up. And in the visual system, we know that, for instance, you know, visual position, where things are is mapped systematically. In other words, neurons that sit next to each other in the brain represent portions of visual space that are next to each other in the real world. What is the organization of language in areas like Wernicke's and Broca's? For instance, I think of the vowels, A, E, I, O, U, as kind of a coherent unit, but do I find the A neurons are next to the E neurons or next to the A, E, I, O, U. Is that vowel representation also laid out in order, or is it kind of salt and pepper, is it random? - That's been one of the, like, most important questions we've been trying to answer for the past decade. So there is a part of the brain that we call the primary auditory cortex, and the primary auditory cortex is deep in the temporal lobe. And if you looked at that part of the brain, there is a map of different sound frequencies. So if you look at the front of that primary auditory cortex, you'll find low-frequency sounds, and then as you march backwards in that cortex, it goes from low to medium to high frequencies. It's organized in this really nice and orderly way. And it turns out there's not just one. There's, like, mirrors of that tone frequency map in the primary auditory cortex. The areas that are really important for speech are on the side of that. And we now think that speech can go straight to the speech cortex without having to go through the primary auditory cortex, that it has its own pathway to get to the part of the brain that processes speech. And when we've looked at that question about is there a map, the short answer is yes, there is a map, but it is not structured universally across all people in a way that we can clearly see right now. It is like a salt and pepper map of the different features in speech. So before, we talked about these sounds that are called plosives. You make a plosive when the mouth or something in the oral cavity closes temporarily, and when it opens, that creates that fast plosive sound. So when you say dad or, you know, like the B in ball, that kind of thing, you will notice that your lips actually close, and then it's the release of that that creates that particular sounds, okay? So those are the sounds that we call plosive. Those are like ba da ga, pa ta ka, Those are a certain class of consonants that we call plosive sounds. There is another class of sounds that we call fricatives in linguistics. Fricatives are created by turbulence in the airstream as it comes out through the mouth, and the way that we make that turbulence is getting the mouth and the lips to close almost until they're completely shut or putting the tongue to near the teeth to almost get it completely shut but just have a narrow aperture, that creates a turbulence in the airflow that we perceive as a high-frequency sound. So those are the sounds like sha and tha, those kind of things. Those are, if you look at the frequencies, they're higher frequencies, and those are created by specific movements that you constrict the airflow to create turbulence, and we hear it as sha, sa, tha. - So if I say that. - [Eddie] Exactly. - And as opposed to a plosive where I'd say explosive. - [Eddie] Right. - Of course, I'm emphasizing here. Well, this explains something and solves a mystery, which is recently I've been fascinated by the work of a physician scientist back east, Dr. Shanna Swan, who's done a lot of work on things that are contained in pesticides and foods that are changing hormone levels, and she refers to phthalates, which is spelled... So it's both a plosive and a tha, so it's combining the two, and it's one of the most difficult words in the English language to pronounce, second only perhaps to the correct pronunciation of ophthalmology. [Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] So it's a combination of a plosive and one of these tha sounds, and that's probably why it's difficult. - That's exactly right. In fact, we have a term for that. That's called a consonant cluster. So sometimes syllables will just have one consonant, but when we start stacking certain syllables in a sequence, and there's rules that actually govern which consonants can be in a particular sequence for a given language, that makes it more complicated. And certain languages have a lot more constant clusters than others. - For instance- - So for instance, Russian, for example, has a lot of consonant clusters. English has a lot of them. There are other languages that have very, very few. For example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian has an inventory of about 12 to 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants and vowels. English, on contrast, has about 40 different consonants and vowels. So languages have different inventories. They can overlap for sure, but different languages use different sound elements, combine and recombine those elements to give rise to different words and meanings. - Can we say that there is a most complicated language out there, or among the most complicated? Would it be Russian? - It's definitely high up there. English is up there, too, actually. Yeah, German as well. - And in terms of learning multiple languages during development, my understanding is that if one wants to become bilingual or trilingual, best to learn those languages simultaneously during development, ideally before age 12, if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later. Is that correct, or do you want to revise that? - Well, basically, the earlier, and the earlier is better, the more intense it is and the more immersive it is, the longer, you know, that you can be exposed to that is really important. A lot of people can get exposed to it early and basically lose it. Even though it's, quote, unquote, during that sensitive period, unless it's maintained, it can be very easily lost. Then I think another aspect of it that's very interesting is some of the social requirements for it too. It's pretty clear that you can only go so far just listening to these sounds from a tape recording or something like that. There's something extra about real human interactions that activates the brain's sensitivity to different speech sounds and allows us to become specialized for them for a given language. - So returning to what's mapped, what the representations are in the brain, I'm starting to get a picture now based on these plosives and these tha sounds. And what I find so interesting and logical about that is it maps to the motor structures and the actual pronunciation of the sounds, not necessarily to the meaning of the individual words. Now, of course, it's related to the meaning of the individual words, but it makes good sense to me why something as complex as language, both to understand and to generate, would map to something that is essentially motor in design because, as you point out, I have to generate these sounds and I have to hear them generated from others. However, there's reading and there's writing, and writing is certainly motor, reading involves some motor commands of the eyes and et cetera. Where do reading and writing come into this picture? Are they in parallel with, as we would say in neuroscience, or are they embedded within the same structures? Are they part of the same series of computations? - Yeah, so to address the first part is that we've got this map of these different parts of consonants and vowels, and when we look at how they lay out in this part of the brain that we call Wernicke's area, we've spent a lot of time really just dissecting this millimeter by millimeter. The term that you used is very apropos. It's salt and pepper. It's not random. There is this kind of selectivity to these individual speech sounds. And one point I want to make about it is this, is that in English, for example, there are about 40 different phonemes. Phonemes are just consonants or vowels or individual speech segments. But these articulatory features that you refer to, for example, the characteristic sounds that are generated by specific movements in the mouth, you can more or less reduce that to about 12 different features. Okay, these are specific movements of the tongue, the jaw, the lips, the larynx. There are about 12 of these movements, and just like you said, Andrew, by themselves, they have no meaning. They're just movements. But what's incredible about it is that you take these 12 movements and you put them in combinations and you start putting them in sequence. We as humans use those 12 set features to generate all words. And because we can generate nearly an infinite number of words with that code of just 12 features, we have something that generates essentially all possible meaning because that's what we do as humans, we generate meanings, I'm trying to communicate one idea to another, which, to me, is extraordinary. A parallel would be, for example, DNA. There's four base pairs in DNA, but with those four base pairs in a specific sequence can generate an entire code for life. And speech is the same way. It's like you've got these fundamental elements that, by themselves, have no meaning, but when you put them together give rise to every possible meaning. So with regard to your second point about reading and writing, it's a fascinating question. Speech and language is part of who we are as humans. That's part of how we evolved, and it's hardwired and, you know, molded by experience. Reading and writing are a human invention. It's something that was added on to the architecture of the brain. And because reading and writing are fairly recent in human evolution, it's essentially too quick for anything to, like, have a dramatic change in, let's say, a new brain area or some kind of specialization. Instead, what happens is that whenever any kind of behavior becomes ultra specialized in any of us or any organism, we can sort of take some areas that are normally involved with vision, for example, and specialize it for the purpose of reading. So all of us have a part of our brain in the back of the temporal lobe that interfaces with the occipital visual cortex that we call a visual word form area. There's actually a part of the brain that is very sensitive to seeing words, like, either typed or handwritten. There's a part of the brain that also is sensitive to seeing things like faces. So these are things that are all conditioned on what's important, you know, to survive. So reading and writing are an invention, and there are things that have mapped to functions that the brain already has. And one of the really important things about reading and writing is that when we learn to read and write, especially with the reading part, it maps to the part of the brain that we've been talking about, which is the part that's processing speech sounds. So some of us kind of think about it, these are two different things. One is hearing sounds through your ears, the other is reading where you're actually seeing things through your eyes and then getting into the language system. Well, it turns out that the auditory speech cortex is the primal and primitive fundamental area that's really important for speech, and what happens with the reading is once it gets through that visual cortex, it's going to try to map those reading signals to the part of the brain that's trying to make sense of sounds, the sounds of words, what we call phonology. Now, why is this important? It has a lot of relevance to how we learn to write. And in some kids with dyslexia... Dyslexia is a neurological condition where a child, in some cases, an adult, has trouble reading, for example. And in many of those cases, it's because that mapping between how we see the words to the way that the brain processes the sounds is something different, it's a little bit different than people who can read really well. So when you're reading, a lot of times, you're actually activating the part of the brain that is processing the words that you hear. - What is the current treatment for dyslexia? I've heard that it's a deficit in some of the motion processing systems of the visual system. You know, people, their eyes are jumping as opposed to more linear reading across, or I suppose if it were Chinese it would be... You know, I don't want to presume people are always reading English. Or I suppose if it's Hebrew, they're going from the opposite side of the page. What can be done for dyslexia? And do any of the modern treatments for dyslexia involve changing things from the speech side as opposed to just the, quote, unquote, reading side, given that speech and reading are interconnected? - Yeah, absolutely. So, again, I think in the beginning, people might have thought this was purely a visual abstraction or something really just about the visual system, but there's been more recognition that it could be both or it could be either, depending on the particular instance. It's very clear that there are many kids with dyslexia where the problem is a problem of a phonological awareness. So, you know, it can be very hard to detect because they may understand the words that you were saying, but because the brain is so good at pattern recognition, sometimes even if the individual speech sounds are not crystal clear, it can compensate that, so that you can have an individual who can hear the words but not be able to essentially hear them when they're reading those same words. And so what can happen with that is that you can have this disconnection between what they're seeing and what they need in order to hear it as words and process it as language. And so skilled readers usually need that route first. They've got to map the vision to the sound in order to get that sort of like foundation. But then over time, the reading has its direct connection to the language parts of the brain, and we don't necessarily always need to map to sounds. You know, you can basically develop a parallel route, and we, as readers, actually use both all the time. So for example, if it's a new word that you've never seen before, sometimes you try to, like, pronounce it in your mind, you know, and try to hear what that word is. Even though you're not actually saying it, you're trying to just generate what those sounds might be like. And that's the part where we're kind of relying on how we learn to read in the first place, which is mapping those word images to the sounds that, you know, go along with them. But in other times, if you're a really proficient reader, you're just seeing the words and you can map them directly to meaning without having to go through that process. - Yeah, I'm a big fan of listening to audiobooks, and of course I also listen to podcasts quite a lot, but I also am a strong believer, based on the research that I've seen, that reading books, physical books, it could be on a Kindle, I suppose, but reading a physical book is useful for being able to articulate well and structure sentences and build what are essentially paragraphs, which is what I'm required to do when I do solo episodes of the podcast. I've noticed over the years as text messaging has become more popular and there's essentially an erosion of punctuation or the need to have complete sentences, and now that's sort of transferred to email as well. It's become acceptable to just say, you know, fragmented sentences in email. It seems likely that it's starting to impact the way that people speak as well. And I don't think this has anything to do with intelligence or education level, but are you aware of any evidence that how we read and what we read and whether or not we consume information purely through reading or mainly through auditory sources, does it change the way that we speak? Because, after all, Wernicke's and Broca's area and the other auditory and speech production areas are heavily intermeshed, and so it would make perfect sense to me that what we hear and the patterns of sound that are being communicated to us would also change the way that we speak. - Yeah, that's a really fascinating point. There is this idea that there's, like, this proper way to speak, like that there's the right way, for example, what are the appropriate, you know... Like, for example, in school, you're oftentimes told, like, \"You should say it like this, not say it like that,\" you know? And every language kind of has that. It turns out that that's really unnatural. Languages, and speech in particular, change over time, it evolves, and it can happen very quickly. You know, the things that we call dialects, for example, are just different ways of speaking, and someone can just be in one environment and change from one dialect to another, and some people, it kind of is really fixed. And there is this idea that, you know, like in school that we're told that there's this right way, but in reality, that's not true. Like, language change and speech change is completely normal and happens all the time, and it can be really dramatic. Like, certain cultures and communities, if they are isolated, they can develop a whole new language, a whole new set of words, for example, and new ways and dialects that are independent from people to the point where it's unintelligible even to others. And so the basic idea is that sound change is part of the way it works, and the brain is very sensitive to those kind of changes. - Speaking of learning new languages, I'm assuming it's possible to learn new languages throughout the lifespan, correct? - [Eddie] Yeah. - I've also heard these kind of fantastical stories of somebody has a stroke and then suddenly, spontaneously, can speak French fluently, whereas prior to the stroke, they could not. Is there any merit to those stories whatsoever? [Eddie laughs] I find it very hard to believe that there was a complete map representation of a language in somebody's brain that they were completely unaware of, and then because of damage to a brain area, that capacity to speak that language was somehow unveiled. It just seems too wild, and I don't want to say good to be true because nobody wants a stroke, but it just seems out outrageously implausible. - Well, there are aspects of that that certainly are implausible. So I don't know of any true case that I've ever seen or experienced myself or even read about where, for example, there was an injury to the brain that resulted in loss of, well, essentially a gain of function, meaning, like, just all of a sudden started speaking another language. So for example, if you had a stroke and you never spoke French, and then you had it and then all of a sudden you're speaking, that, I've never heard of and never seen. However, there is a condition that is well acknowledged and I have seen one case of this called a foreign accent syndrome, which is peculiar because there are people who have an injury to the part of the brain where it sounds like they're starting to speak this other language, but they're not actually speaking the language, it just sounds like it. And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier about these areas that are really important for speech control of the vocal tract, this area in the precentral gyrus. People have documented where, you know, patients have had strokes there, and after that, it sounds like they're speaking Spanish as opposed to English or it sounds like they have the intonational properties of French or Russian as compared to their original native language. They're not learning all the rest of it, like the meaning and the grammar, et cetera, but they're adopting some of the phonology, and part of that is just because it's not working the way it normally does. So there is something actually called a foreign accent syndrome that people can have after a stroke. - Interesting. I'm curious about auditory memory. When I was a kid, I used to get into bed at night, and I'd close my eyes and I would replay conversations that I had heard during the day or people's voices. I actually can remember calling your house when we were young kids, and because I don't speak any Chinese but I'd have to ask for you, I'd say, I think it was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. - Yeah. - Yeah, and then whoever answered the phone would go get you, and then I'd say [speaking Chinese], which I believe means thank you, right? That's the total of the Chinese that I speak, by the way, but I will never forget that. I'll just never forget it, I hope. I suppose if I have a stroke or something of that sort, at some point, I'll forget it and I won't know that I've forgotten it. But in all seriousness, I remember that to this day. I couldn't spell that out, I wouldn't know how, certainly not in Chinese, but even a transliteration, I couldn't do using English letters. Where are memories of sounds stored? Because within our days and across our lives, we have an infinite number of auditory experiences, just like we have an infinite number of visual experiences. Where are they stored, and what is the structure of their storage? What am I calling upon, besides, of course, the motor commands that are required to say what I just said in Chinese, which I won't repeat again, 'cause I somehow managed to get it right the first time, or at least not terribly wrong, then I don't want to botch it the second time. Where is that stored, and how does that work? And, more importantly, as I speak my native language, English, am I pulling from a memory bank? Because it doesn't feel like it. I'm just telling you what I want to say. I'm doing my best to communicate clearly and succinctly. I'm usually not so good at the succinct part. But where is the bank of information? On my keyboard on my computer, I have the letters, and I have certain elements of punctuation and the space. What am I pulling from? Am I pulling from those plosives? But if so, how can I do it so quickly? Even for people that speak slowly, it appears more or less fluid. This, to me, is overwhelmingly impressive that the brain can do that. How does it do that? - Well, first of all, I am impressed that 35 years later... [laughs] - Well, I had to get ahold of you. [laughs] - Yeah, so I am impressed, 35 years later, that you can still remember that. - But only that. - That's fine, but I'm still very impressed. But it clearly was something important to you. So the short answer is that memory is very distributed. So it's almost like the question that you asked me is ill posed 'cause you asked me where? Well, it's not one specific area. It's actually really distributed. It's not just one particular area. In fact, I'm fairly certain that if we were to injure that part of the brain called the Wernicke's area, you may still even have memories of that. People can have injuries of Broca's area or certainly the precentral gyrus and be able to sing \"Happy Birthday,\" for example, when it's embedded in melody or highly rehearsed things like counting despite not being able to speak, which is incredible, right? It's like you can see a patient, for example, who can't really put together a sentence. You ask them, \"How are you feeling today?\" And they can't even utter a word. But then you ask them to count sometimes, and they'll get up to any number really. And so there are some things that are really built into our motor memory and it's distributed. It's not one particular part of the brain, it's actually multiple areas where that memory is distributed. And thank God that's the way it is because it's very rare in the kind of surgeries that I do where you go in, you remove a piece of the brain, that someone forgets these kind of long-term memories or these long-term motor skills that they have. That's very, very rare. It's the number one question a patient will ask me, like, \"Am I going to be the same? And am I going to remember, you know, my wife? Or am I going to remember, you know, these thoughts of my birthday when I was 10 years old?\" And I've never really seen that kind of severe amnesia unless it's a very, very severe injury that involves almost the entire brain, and thank God. So a lot of that information is really distributed across the entire brain. - Speaking of storage of and ability to speak, you are doing some amazing work and have achieved some pretty incredible, well-deserved recognition for your work in bringing language out of paralyzed people, essentially allowing people who are locked into a paralyzed state or otherwise unable to articulate speech using brain-machine interfaces, essentially translating the neural activity of areas of the brain that would produce speech into hardware, wires and things of that sort, artificial, non-biological tools in order to allow paralyzed people to communicate. We will provide a link to some of the popular press coverage of that work and the original papers. But if you would be so kind as to tell us what those experiments look like, who these people are who are locked in and that you allow to communicate, and then especially interesting to me, some of the directions that you're taking this now, which is beyond just, you know, people being able to think about what they want to say and words coming out on a screen or through a microphone, but actually making the interactions between these people and the real world more elaborate and more real. If that seems mysterious to people, I'm going to let Eddie tell you what they're doing with this rather than put any more detail on it. - Oh, okay. Well, thanks for asking about this. This has really been some of the exciting recent work from the lab. So for the last decade, we've really been focusing on the basic science, meaning trying to understand how the brain extracts and produces speech sounds and words. We've done a lot of work trying to figure out how these parts of the brain control these individual elements that give rise to all words and meanings. And so it was about six years ago where we realized we actually have a pretty good idea of how this code works. We had identified all of these different elements that we could decode in epilepsy patients, for example, when they had electrodes on the brain as part of their surgeries, we could decode all of the different consonants and vowels of English. That was about six years ago. So a natural question was this, which is if we understand that electrical code, can we use that to help someone who is paralyzed and can't get those signals out of the brain to speak normally? And that's in the setting of people who are paralyzed. So there are a series of conditions, they include things like brain stem stroke. The brain stem is the part of the brain that connects the cerebrum, which is the top part, does our thinking and a lot of the motor control, speech, language, everything, and the brain stem is what connects that to the spinal cord and the nerves that go out to the face and vocal tract. So if you have a stroke there, basically, you could be thinking all the wild, creative, intelligent thoughts you have in the mind and the cerebrum, but you can't get them out into words or you can't get them out to your hand to write them down. So that's a very severe form of paralysis called brain stem stroke. There's another kind of conditions that we call neurodegenerative where the nerve cells die basically, or atrophy, in a condition called ALS, and that's a very severe form of paralysis. In its extreme form, people essentially lose all voluntary movement. - So Stephen Hawking would be a good example of someone with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? - He's an example of someone who had ALS but not a great example of what typical course of ALS. So for reasons not clear, the progression of his disease largely stabilized to the point where he could twitch, you know, a cheek muscle or move his eyes, let's say. In most people, it's very rapid, and many people, they die from it, actually, you know, within a couple of years of diagnosis, so- - Yeah, he lived a long time in that- - He lived a long time- - That slanted-over state in his wheelchair. - Right, exactly. But he wasn't breathing, you know, through a tube in his throat, for example, because people with severe ALS, the muscles to their diaphragm and their lungs essentially give out as well. They get weakness there and then they can't breathe anymore. So that's another form of paralysis. And so in our field, these are kind of like the most devastating things that can happen. I'm not going to really try to compare, like, what's worse, you know, having a brain tumor or a stroke, it's all bad. But this condition of what we call being locked in refers to this idea that you can have completely intact cognition and awareness but have no way to express that, no voluntary movement, no ability to speak. And that is devastating because psychologically and socially, you know, you're completely isolated. That's what we call locked-in syndrome, and it's devastating. I've seen that throughout my career, and it's really heartbreaking because you know that the person is there but you can't see, they can't communicate. So we've been studying this patterning of electrical activity for consonants and vowels, and essentially, once we figured out a lot of these codes for the individual phonetic elements, we took a little bit of a detour, or at least part of the lab started to focus on this very specific question. For people who have these kind of paralysis, could we intercept those signals from the brain, the cerebral cortex, as someone is trying to say those words, and then can we intercept them and then have them taken out of the brain through wires to a computer that are going to interpret those signals and translate them into words? So about three years ago, we started a clinical trial. It's called the BRAVO trial. It's still underway. And the first participant in the BRAVO trial was a man who had been paralyzed for 15 years. When he was about 20 years old, he came to the United States, was actually working in the Sonoma area and he was in a car accident, and he actually walked out of the hospital day after that car accident, but the next day, had a complication related to it where he had a very large stroke in the brain stem, and that turned out to be devastating. He didn't wake up from that stroke for about a week. He was in a coma for about a week. And when he woke up from that coma, he realized that he couldn't speak or move his arms or legs. And as he told me or communicated to us, that was absolutely devastating. He wanted really to die at that time. - Could he blink his eyes or move his mouth in any way? - He could blink his eyes, he had some limited mouth movements but couldn't produce any intelligible speech. It was, like, completely slurred and incomprehensible. And he survived this injury. A lot of people who have that kind of stroke just don't survive. But he survived. And I also realized that he's just an incredible person, like a force of nature in terms of his optimism, in terms of his ability to make friends despite his condition. The way he actually communicates, because he has a little bit of residual neck movements, is that he improvised and had his friends basically put a stick attached to his baseball cap. And because he could move his neck, he would essentially type out letters on a keyboard screen to get out words. In fact, this is how he communicated was through a device that he would essentially peck out letters one by one by moving his neck to control this stick attached to his baseball cap. - How many years did he use that method of communication? - [Eddie] For about 15 years. He hadn't really spoken for about 15 years. - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. So it was a devastating injury. But, you know, there's something to be said about the human spirit, and if there's anyone who embodies it, it is Pancho, that's his nickname, the first participant in our trial. He has that human spirit, he persevered, and, in fact, you know, could thrive in his community, basically, and friends, being able to communicate in this very slow and inefficient way. Maybe part of that spirit is why he volunteered to be the first person in this trial. It was a clinical trial, an experiment. It was a study. This is not an approved therapy by any means. This was really something that had not been done before, and we had a lot of ideas about it, but we didn't know. You know, we had proven a lot of this could be true in some people who are normally speaking, but to actually put it into someone who's paralyzed, number one, where we don't know the code is the same. Number two is someone who's not been speaking for 15 years, whether those signals are actually still there or not. So it was part of a clinical trial. It was, you know, something that our hospital and also the FDA, you know, had to approve and looked at very carefully, but given a lot of the work that we had done, there was some basis for why this might work. And so about two and a half years ago, we did a surgery where we implanted electrodes onto the parts of the brain that we've been talking about, these areas that control the vocal tract, the areas that control the larynx, the areas that control the lips and tongue and jaw movements when we normally speak. These are areas that presumably may be active, that was our hope, in his brain, but he just couldn't get those out to control his mouth in a normal way. And he underwent a surgery, a brain surgery where we put an electrode array and we connected it to a port that was screwed to his skull. And the port actually goes through his scalp, and he's lived with this now for the last three years. It is a risk of infection. These ports eventually have to become wireless in the future. But we've figured out a way to keep that port there where we can essentially connect him to a computer through that port. So he has an electrode array that's implanted over the part of his brain that's important for speech, it's connected to a port, and then we connect a wire to that port that translates those what we call analog, you know, brainwaves and converts them into digital signals. And then a computer takes those digital signals from those individual sites from the speech cortex and translates those into words. - Can you describe for us the first time that Pancho spoke through this engineered device? What was that experience like for you? And, at least from what he conveyed to you, what was that experience like for him? Because as somebody who was essentially locked-in, except for this, you know, rather crude pecking device, although I'm thoroughly impressed by how adaptive or adaptable Pancho was, and his friends engineering that device for him is really nothing short of clever because otherwise he would be truly locked in, right? But what was that moment like? I can only imagine. - That moment was incredible. It was truly incredible to be able to see him try to get out a word that was, for all practical purposes, unintelligible, but to be able to take the brain activity and to translate it into text on a screen. And that's what we did. We took those brainwaves, we put them through a machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithm that can pick up these very, very subtle patterns, you can't actually see them with your eye, in the brain activity and translate those into words. And I remember seeing this happening for the first time. You know, it doesn't happen, like, immediately. This is something that took weeks to train the algorithm to interpret it correctly. But what was incredible about it was to see how he reacted. And he would be prompted to say a given word, like, you know, outside, for example, and then he would think about it, try to say it, and finally those words would appear on the screen. And what was really amazing about it was you could really tell that he, like, got a kick out of that because he would start to giggle, you know, his body would shake in a way and his head would shake in a way that he would start to giggle, and that was cool to see. But then I also realized that when he was giggling, it kind of screwed up the next word's decoding. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - Is that a bug you've since fixed? - No, we haven't fixed that. - Interesting. - We haven't fixed that, so it's easier just to tell him to stop giggling. [Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] - So what was the first word that he said? - Well, I think one of the first sentences that he put together was, you know, can you get my family outside? - Meaning get them out of the room? [laughs] - [Eddie] No, no. - All these years, he wanted to get away from his family? - No, I think what he meant was, can you get them- - Bring them in, yeah. - Bring them in. And so the way this worked was we trained this computer to recognize 50 words. We started with a very small vocabulary that's expanding as we speak. I think that this is just a matter of time before these vocabularies become much, much larger. But we started with a 50-set of words. We created essentially all the possible sentences that you could generate from those 50 words. Why that was important was you can use all those possible sentences to create a computational model, computer model of all the different word combinations to give different sentences given those 50 words, and then you can essentially do what we call autocorrect. It's the same kind of thing that we do when you're texting, for example. You get the wrong letter in there, but your phone actually knows, you know, because of its context what to correct it. So because the decoding's not 100% correct all the time, in fact, it's far from that, it's really helpful to have these other features like autocorrect, the stuff that we use routinely now with texting that makes it correct and then updates it. So it's a combination of a lot of things. It's the AI that is translating those brain activity patterns, but it's also things that we've learned from speech and speech technologies that, you know, we put all together and then all of a sudden, it starts to work. And so we were really excited because that was the first time that someone was paralyzed and could create words and sentences that was just decoded from the brain activity. - Incredible, and I know you're very humble, but I'm going to embarrass you by saying I always knew you were destined for great things since the early age of nine when we first became friends. But when I read the news coverage of your work with Pancho and the release of this language from this locked-in patient, it literally, you know, it brought tears to my eyes because, you know, it's an interesting thing as fellow neuroscientists, right, we explore the brain and we try and find mechanisms, and we try and compare those to what other people find and find truths and principles and build up from those, but pretty rarely is there a case where that route of exploration leads to something of clinical significance within one's own lifetime. I mean, that's the reality of science, and oftentimes it's a very distributed process. But in this case, it's been a magnificent thing to see you move along this trajectory parsing these language and speech areas and then to also do the clinical work in parallel. Speaking of which, these days, we hear a lot about Neuralink, Elon Musk's company. A neurosurgeon that came up briefly through my lab, but I can't take any credit for what he knows or does, which is Matt MacDougall is the neurosurgeon at Neuralink. There's some other excellent neuroscientists there and engineers there. We hear a lot about Neuralink because while brain-machine interface of the sort that you do and that other laboratories do has been going on for a long time, there's been some press around Neuralink about the promise of what brain-machine interface could do. For instance, early in our discussion, you talked about how, you know, language is constrained by these sound waves, and typically, it's a few people communicating or one person with many people through a podcast, for instance, or a speech. But the idea has been thrown out there that through the use of stimulating chips or through other brain-machine devicing that perhaps one could internalize 50 conversations in parallel, right? 50X communication, or that the memory systems could be augmented to remember 10 times as much information or even twice as much information in a given period of time. My understanding of what they're doing at Neuralink, which is admittedly crude and from the outside, a few discussions with people there, is that they too are going to pursue clinical goals first, things like trying to generate smooth movement in a Parkinsonian patient, trying to adjust movement patterns in someone with Huntington's disease, for instance, things of that sort before they embark on the more sci-fi-like explorations of 50Xing communication or doubling memory capacity and these kinds of things. Although, I don't know, they may be doing all of those things in parallel. What are your thoughts about super capabilities of the brain or, I don't even know what word to use, you know, supercharging the brain, you know, giving the brain functions for which we've never observed before in human history, right? We have our Einsteins and our Feynmans and our Merzenichs and, you know, it's unclear who to put in along that line side by side, but there are some, the Michael Jordans and et cetera, but we've never heard of or seen somebody who can jump 20 feet in the air. Or we've heard of people who have photographic memories, but I don't know that we are aware of any human being in history who could memorize the entire Library of Congress or all the works within the Vatican within an hour. Anyway, you get the idea. What are your thoughts about manipulating neural circuitry to achieve suprahuman or superhuman or supraphysiological functions? Are we there, or should we even be thinking about that? Is it possible given that neurons simply communicate through electrical activity and electrical activity can be engineered outside of the brain? How do you think about it? And here, we don't even have to think about Neuralink in particular. It's just but one example of companies and people in laboratories that are quite understandably considering all this. - Well, it's a really interesting time right now. The science has been going on for decades. The work that we've done in this field that you call brain-machine interface has been going on for a while. And a lot of the early work was just trying to restore things like arm movement or having people or monkeys control a computer cursor, for example, on the screen. That's been going on for decades. What's been really new is that industry is now involved and some of this is now becoming commercialized, and we're starting to see us now cross over to this field where it's no longer just research, that we're talking about medical products that are designed to be, you know, surgically implanted in some cases. You know, there's people doing this kind of work non-invasively as well that don't require surgery. The specific question that you are asking about is an area that we call augmentation. So can you build a device that essentially enhances someone's ability beyond supranormal, super memory, super communication speeds beyond speech, for example, I guess superior precision athletic abilities? I think that these are very serious kind of questions to be asking now because, as you mentioned, the pathway so far is really to focus on these medical applications. I personally don't think that we've thought enough actually about what these kind of scenarios are going to look like, and I don't think we've thought through all the ethical implications of what this means for augmentation in particular. There's part of this that is not new at all. Humans throughout history have been doing things to augment our function, coffee, nicotine, all kinds of things, all kinds of medications that cross over from medical to consumer. That is everywhere. So the pursuit of augmentation or performance or enhancement is really not a new thing. The questions really, as they relate to neurotechnologies, for example, have to do with the invasive nature. For example, if these technologies require surgery, for example, to do something that is not for a medical application. Again, there, that is not exactly new territory either. People do that routinely for cosmetic kind of procedures for physical appearance, not necessarily cognitive. So I do think that, provided the technology continues to emerge the way that it does, that it's going to be around the corner, and it probably is not going to be in ways that are super obvious. I don't think it's going to be like, can we easily memorize every fact in the world, but in forms that are going to be much more incremental and maybe more subtle. In many ways, we already have that now. Like, for example, you don't have to have a neural interface embedded in your brain to get information, essentially access to all information in the world. You just have to have, you know, your iPhone. Whether you could do it faster through a brain interface, I definitely wouldn't rule that out. But think about this, that the systems that we have already to speak and to communicate have evolved over, you know, thousands and millions of years and they're supported by neural structures that have bandwidth of millions of neurons. There is no technology that exists right now that people are thinking about that are in commercial forms, certainly not even in research labs, that come anywhere close to what has been evolved for those natural purposes. So I'm essentially saying two sides of this, which is we're already getting into this now, this is not new territory, this topic of augmentation, both physical and cognitive, we've already surpassed that. That's part of what humans do in general. But we are entering this area of, like, enhanced cognition, these areas that I think the technology is going to be the rate-limiting step in how far it can go, and we have not had the full conversations about, number one, is this what we actually want? Is this going to be good for society? Who gets access to this technology? These are all things that are going to become real-world problems. - There's certainly a lot to consider. In thinking about augmentation and another theme that I've yet to ask you about but I'm extremely curious about, which is facial expressions. Before we talk about the relationship between the musculature of the face and language and the communication of emotion, I'd love for you to, if you would, touch on a little bit of what you're doing with patients like Pancho to move beyond somebody who's locked in being able to type out words on a screen with their thoughts. There's a rich array of information contained within the face and facial expression. And while somebody like Pancho going from having to, you know, be completely locked in to being able to peck out letters on a keyboard to being able to just think of those letters and having them spelled out, that's a tremendous set of leaps forward towards normalcy. It's still far and away different than Pancho speaking with his mouth, which I think, knowing some people who are restricted, who are quadriplegic, you know, a lot of what they struggle with in the real world is actually a height difference sometimes because they're seated while other people are standing. We don't often think about this, but to always have to look up to communicate with people is a very different interface in the world. They manage quite well, of course. But could you tell us what you're doing in terms of merging the brain-machine interface with extraction of speech signals from people who are locked-in like Pancho with facial expressions? - Sure, yeah. Well, like we described before, progress is being made. The proof of principle is out there that you can decode speech. That will continue to optimize, and I'm very confident that that's going to improve very, very quickly in the coming years to the point where it's like, you know, not just a small vocabulary, but a large vocabulary and at reasonable rates, at a level that's going to be really helpful. I'm very optimistic about that. I think it's the right time to start really thinking about a broader vision of what communication really is. So for example, I'm here with you in person. We could have done this virtually, probably, it's pretty easy to do that. We could've recorded this really separate, but there is something about being able to actually see your expressions and to understand other forms of communication. So another really important one is nonverbal, the expressions that you're making. You know, for example, if you have a quizzical look on your face if I'm saying something not clear, that's a sign to me that I need to rephrase it or to say it in a different way or to slow down, for example. Or if there's something that really excites you, I want to continue to say more about it and talk more in detail, you know, essentially about a given thing. So facial expressions actually are a really important part of the way we speak, and there's two things. It's not just the expressions of, like, how you're feeling and perceiving what I'm saying, but it's also seeing my mouth move and your eyes actually seeing my mouth move and my jaw move in a particular way that actually allows you to hear those sounds better. So having both the visual information but also the sounds go into your brain is going to improve intelligibility, also make it more natural. - And memory for what is spoken? - Perhaps. - So here's a call for people not just listening to podcasts but watching them and listening to them on YouTube, I suppose, if we were to sort of translate this to the real world. - Exactly, exactly. And the reason why we're also very interested in this idea of not just having text on a screen, but essentially a fully computer-animated face like an avatar of the person's speech movements and their facial expressions is going to be a more complete form of expression. Now, you can imagine right now, that might just be someone looking at a computer screen interpreting these signals, but I think the way things are going, in the next couple of years, a lot more of our social interactions, more than even now, are going to move into this digital virtual space. And, of course, most people are thinking about what that means for most consumers, but it also has really important implications for people who are disabled, right, and how are they going to participate in that. And so we are thinking really about, for people like Pancho and other people who are paralyzed, what other forms of BCI can we do in order to help improve their ability to communicate? So one is essentially building out more holistic avatars, you know, things that can essentially decode, you know, essentially their expressions or the movements associated with their mouth and jaw when they actually speak to improve that communication. - So do you envision a time not too long from now where instead of tweeting out something in text, my avatar will, I'll type it out, but my avatar will just say it, it'll be an image of my avatar saying whatever it is I happen to be tweeting at that moment. - That's what we're working on, yeah. So I don't think that... That is going to happen and it's going to happen soon, and there's a lot of progress in that. And, again, we're just trying to enrich the field, you know, of communication expression to make it more normal. And we actually think that having that kind of avatar is a way of getting feedback to people learning how to speak through a speech neuroprosthetic, that's the device that we call, it's a speech neuroprosthetic, that that is going to be the way that can help people learn how to do it the quickest. Not necessarily, like, trying to say words and having it come on a screen, but actually have people embody, feel like it's part of themselves or that they are directly controlling that illustration or animation. - This idea of an avatar speaking out what we would otherwise write is fascinating to me. On Instagram, I post videos, I don't filter them, but I know there's a lot of discussion nowadays about people using filters to make their skin look different or the lighting look different, a lot of filtering and also the use of captions, so that essentially what you end up with is somewhere between an actual raw video of what was spoken and an avatar version of it. - Yeah. - I mean, if the mismatch between what's spoken and what's in the caption is too dramatic, then it doesn't quite work. But I watch these carefully when people use captions, and oftentimes there's a smoothing of what was said into the captions so it seems much more succinct and accurate. Oftentimes, the reverse is also true where the caption is inaccurate and then it creates this kind of jarring mismatch. In any case, I think this aspect in the clinical realm of using an avatar to allow people like Pancho to essentially be a face that communicates through spoken language from an avatar that looks like them is fascinating and indeed important, and I think how avatars emerge in social spaces is going to be really fascinating. I get a lot of questions about stutter. I think that for people who have a stutter, it is itself anxiety-provoking. Is stutter related to anxiety? If one has a stutter, what can they do? Does stutter reflect some underlying neurologic phenomenon that might distinguish between one kind of stutter and another? What can people with stutter do if they'd like to relieve their stutter? - Yeah, great question. Stutter is a condition where the words can't come out fluently. So you have all the ideas, you've got the language intact. You know, remember, we talked about this distinction between language and speech. Stuttering is a problem of speech, right? So the ideas, the meanings, the grammar, it's all there, and people stutter but they can't get the words out fluently. So that's a speech condition, and, in particular, it's a condition that affects articulation, specifically about controlling the production of words in this really coordinated kind of movements that have to happen in the vocal tract to produce fluent speech. And stuttering is a condition where people have a predisposition to it, so there is an aspect of stuttering, you are a stutterer or you're not a stutterer, right? But people who stutter don't stutter all the time either, so you could be a stutterer who stutters at some times but not others. And, really, the main link between stuttering and anxiety is that anxiety can provoke it and make it worse. That's certainly true, but it's not necessarily caused by anxiety. It can essentially trigger it or make it worse, but it's not the cause of it, per se. So the cause of it is still really not clear, but it does have to do with these kind of brain functions that we've been talking about earlier, which is that in order to produce normal fluent speech, we're not even conscious of what is going on in our mouths, in our larynx. We're not conscious, and if we were, we would not be able to speak because it's too complex, it's too precise. It's something that we have really developed the abilities to do, and we do it naturally, right? It's part of our programming and part of what we learn inherently, you know, just through exposure. So stuttering is essentially a breakdown at certain times in that machinery being able to work in a really coordinated way. You can think about, you know, the operations of these areas that are controlling the vocal tract. Let's say speech is like a symphony. In order for it to come out normally, you've got to have not just one part, the larynx, but the lips, the jaw. They can't be doing their own thing. They have to be very, very precisely activated and very, very precisely controlled in a way to actually create words. And so in stuttering, there's a breakdown of that coordination. - If somebody has a stutter, is it better to address that early in life when there's still neuroplasticity that is very robust? And if so, what's the typical route for treatment? I have to imagine it's not brain surgery typically. I'm guessing there are speech therapists that people can talk to, and they can help them work out where they're getting stuck and the relationship to anxiety. - Yeah, exactly. I mean, part of it is about that anxiety, but a lot of it really has to do with therapy to sort of like work through and think of tricks basically sometimes to create conditions where you can actually get the words to come out. Some forms of stuttering are really initiation problems. Just getting started itself is very hard. You want to start with initial vowel or consonant, but it won't emit. And so a lot of the therapy is really just focusing on, like, how do you create the conditions, you know, for that to happen? There's another aspect to it that I find very interesting is that the feedback, essentially, what we hear ourselves say, for example, and every time that I say a word, I'm also hearing what I'm saying, so that's what we call auditory feedback. That turns out to be very important, and sometimes when you change that, it can actually change the amount someone stutters for better or for worse. And it's giving us a clue that the brain is not just focused on sending the commands out, but it's also possibly interacting with the part that is hearing the sounds, and there's something might be going on in that connection that breaks down when stuttering occurs. So there are individuals that are stutterers but they don't stutter all the time. In those instances, there's something happening in those particular moments where this very, very precise coordination needs to happen in the brain in order to get the words out fluently. - We've talked a little bit about caffeine and why you avoid it. Because your work requires such precision and calm, and, frankly, to me, it seems like you're running a lot of operations, no pun intended, in parallel when you're doing surgery, not just thinking about where to direct the instruments, but also thinking like a chess player several steps down the line what could happen, what if, if-then type thinking. What are some of the other practices and tools that you use to put yourself into state for optimal neurosurgery or for, you know, thinking about scientific problems for that matter? We keep threatening to go running together, but I know you run, correct? - Yeah. - Do you find running to be an essential part of your state regulation? - Absolutely, yeah. So for me, most exercise that I do, I really don't do for physical reasons. I do it for mental reasons. I can tell, for example, if I don't go on a run or a swim just after a day or two, and it can have translation, for example, in the way I feel in the operating room or even the way I interact with other people. So there's no question that, you know, the mind and body are deeply connected, and for me personally, being able to have opportunity to disconnect for a while, it turns out to be really, really important. Now, the operating room, for me, is another space, kind of like running or swimming, where I'm disconnected from the rest of the world. I don't bring my cell phone into the operating room. I'm disconnected from the external world for that time that I'm in the surgery, and all I am doing is just focusing. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm having complex thoughts or doing something very complicated. Sometimes it is like that, but it's not always like that. There are things that we do in surgery that are, like, routine and rote and are from muscle memory. So, for example, suturing skin or doing certain kinds of dissection or drilling part of the bone, for example, these are all things that become very rote after a time. So, for me, even being in the operating room actually can sometimes fulfill that purpose. So I really look forward to being in the operating room because that intense focus allows me to sort of disconnect from all the other things that I'm worrying about, you know, that are happening out in the outside world. You know, we all have those kind of things that happen, and I'm certainly no exception to that. But, strangely, the operating room, for me, is a sanctuary. I love being there because we have some control over the environment. I know what is there, I know the anatomy of the brain, my motions are going through routines. And so for me, that's not actually very different than going on a run and letting my, you know, legs move in specific ways. It's just the same thing for my hands. - Do you listen to music or audiobooks when you run, or are you divorced from technology when you run? - Well, music helps me, like, just stay motivated and distracted from being out of breath and other things. And for me, it's a way to just catch up with, like, the world. So sometimes I do, but I do notice that, like, I don't run as well, for example. In the operating room, it's a little different. You know, different surgeons have preferences. I'm more of the camp where I don't like any distraction whatsoever. I like people to be able to hear the words that I'm saying without having background noise. I don't really think about relying on music or other things to try to put me in a state of mind. You know, I think just being there alone and just, you know, trying to treat it the way it is, it's a sacred moment where someone's life is really directly under your hands, That enough kind of focuses me very quickly, and I like that. It really detaches me from a lot of the things that are preoccupying me, and for those couple of hours that we have a surgery, we're just focused on one thing only. - That's fantastic. Again, I think of, in the range of brain explorers, the neurosurgeons, those of your profession, are, to me, like the astronauts of neuroscience because they're really going to the farthest reaches possible, and they're testing and probing and really at the front edge of discovering from the species that we arguably care about the most, which is humans. Eddie, I have to say, from the first time we became friends 38 years ago... - Something like that. - Something like that. I'm almost reluctant to say, so I only reveal it in part that Eddie and I became friends because both he and I shared a love of birds, and we had a club at our school of which there were only two members, Eddie and I. - Small club. - Small club. There was one honorary member, and there were certain requirements for being in this club that we won't reveal. We took a pact of secrecy, and we're going to obey that pact of secrecy. But to be sitting here with you today, for me, is a absolute thrill, not just because we've been friends for that long or that we got reacquainted through literally the halls of medicine and science, but because I really do see what you're doing as really representing that front, absolute cutting edge of exploration and application. I mean, the story of Pancho is but one of your many patients that has derived tremendous benefit from your work. And now as the chair of a department, you, of course, work alongside individuals who are also doing incredible work in the spinal cord, et cetera. So on behalf of myself and everyone listening, I just really want to thank you for joining us today to share this information. We will certainly have you back because there's an entire list of other questions we didn't have time to get to, but also just for the work you do, it's truly spectacular. - Andrew, thanks so much. You know, I'm very humbled basically by what you just said, and I feel that it's really an extraordinary honor actually and privilege, you know, to be here with you and reconnect and talk about all these ideas. It's probably not random, you know, that we ended up in similar spots and interests. I think when we were kids, you know, it starts with some deep interests and kind of nerding out on topics, and it's probably not a coincidence, you know, that we have such deep interest in this work now. I just feel really lucky to be able to do what I do. It's fun every day, almost every day, be able to go to work and take care of folks and learn at the same time and then just close the loop, you know, how do we apply the knowledge that we learn one day to someone who comes in next week? It's really fun. And we don't know everything, we're not even close to it, but the journey to figure this out, it's really extraordinary. I mean, it's like you said, it's exploring new lands. Literally in the operating room when I'm looking at the exposed cortex trying to understand is it safe to walk down this part of the cortical landscape or this other trail? You know, which one is going to be the one that is going to be safe versus the other that results in paralysis and inability to talk? Well, maybe I shouldn't call it fun, but it's very important, too, in addition to being really intellectually important for how we understand how the brain works. And so, yeah, I feel just really lucky to be in that opportunity. - And we're lucky to have you being one of the people doing it, so thank you ever so much. - Thanks. - Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Dr. Eddie Chang.

    "summary": "We talk about how the brain controls movement of the very muscles that allow for speech and language and how those can be modified over time. We also talk about stutter, and we talk about a number of aspects of speech and language that give insight into not just how we create this incredible thing called speech or how we understand speech and language, but how the brain works more generally. In particular, we were trying to think about how the brain organizes when you have patterns of sound. And we have this for our eyes, but we also have it for our ears. And that's pretty extraordinary that human brain has that flexibility yet, at the same time, has that specialization for language. And so we were trying to think about how do we model this, for example, in rodents, who obviously don't speak, but we're just understanding how sounds and environmental sounds modulate and organize the auditory cortex. It actually slowed the maturation of the auditory cortex. And would that impact their tendency to speak in a certain way as well as hear in a certain way? There is a value to having really salient, structured sounds that are part of our natural environment to actually have the brain develop normally.\nDr. Eddie Chang is a neurosurgeon and professor of neurosurgery at the University of California, San Francisco.

    "rawText": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series, where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the first in a series with Dr. Andy Galpin. Dr. Andy Galpin is a professor of kinesiology at Cal State University Fullerton and one of the foremost world experts on the science and application of methods to increase strength, speed, endurance, hypertrophy, and various other aspects of fitness, exercise, and sports performance. Across this six episode series, Dr. Andy Galpin pulls from his expertise working with everything from professional athletes to recreational exercisers and teaches us the mechanisms, logic, and specific protocols for how to achieve any of the number of different exercise adaptations that I mentioned a moment ago, ranging from strength to endurance, hypertrophy, and everything in between. We get really far into details, but at all times paying attention to the macroscopic issues. That is, how to create a program for endurance or strength or hypertrophy or speed, or one that combines all of those. We also talk about supplementation and nutrition and how to maximize recovery for each of the different types of exercise adaptations. During today's episode, Dr. Galpin teaches us how to assess our level of fitness and, more generally, how to think about fitness so that we can best achieve our fitness exercise and performance goals. Dr. Professor Andy Galpin. Super excited to have you here. You're such an immense treasure trove of information on physical training and optimizing for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise. I'm curious, however-- so many people have different levels of fitness. Some people are professional athletes, of course, but most people are not. Many people exercise regularly. Some people are trying to do that more. Some people are doing too much of that; they're overtraining, they're not recovering enough. If we were to take a step back and each and every one of us ask how fit are we, with the word fit, of course, being a very broad encompassing word, could encompass endurance, certainly it does, strength, the ability to run fast, even if for short distances, it might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophy, trying to balance one's musculature to offset asymmetries, recover from injuries, et cetera. How should I, or anyone else for that matter think about their level of fitness? I know my resting heart rate, but what do I do in terms of really assessing whether or not I'm as fit as I could be and should be both for sake of health and performance? And here I'm asking you the question not as an athlete, but as somebody who's been pretty consistent as an exerciser. But if we were to throw our arms around this question of how do we assess our fitness, what would be the different levels of assessment that we should think about and do? ANDY GALPIN: When it comes to exercise, people generally have two major goals in mind. Goal number one is achieving some sort of appearance. Right? This is I want to be big, or I want to not be too big, or I want to be lean. Something, right? It doesn't matter what that goal is, but there is an aesthetic component to almost everybody. They want to look a certain way or not look a certain way. The other one is functionality. So I want to be able to perform a certain way. Now, again, that definition differs per person. So I want to be better at strength, I want to be better at mobility, I want to be able to have energy throughout the day, whatever it is. So there's some sort of appeal to aesthetic and there's some sort of appeal to functionality. So within both of those categories, we want to be in a position where we can understand, where do I need to go with my exercise training so that I can be as fit and as healthy and achieve these goals that I want now, as well as be in a position where I can maintain them for a long period of time. So this blends both immediate goals. So say you're just interested in squatting a lot of weights. Say you're interested in running a 5K time the best run. It doesn't matter. It blends that with the desire to have a long wellness span, to be fit throughout life, to achieve all those things for as long as possible. So then the question kind of comes back to saying, well, how do I know which area I need to focus on the most, and why am I not achieving these goals, or how can I get there more effectively. And if we look at the big picture, we have to understand that there are several major components to physical fitness that are going to be required in all of these categories. And to achieve that, there are a handful of components that have to happen to be able to hit those goals. Now there are infinite methods. So the saying we actually use here a lot is, the methods are many, but the concepts are few. So what I'd love to do today is, over the course of our discussion is hit exactly what those concepts are and then cover a whole bunch of different methods. And we could do that for hours. But we'll cover a number of them for various goals. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So one of the reasons I went into neuroscience and not into exercise science is because of this thing neuroplasticity, the nervous system's ability to adapt. But the more time I spend with you and the more I learn from you, I realize that many, if not all of the organ systems of our body have this incredible ability to adapt. And when we're talking about physical exercise, there are incredible adaptations that, of course, involve the nervous system, but also involve muscle and connective tissue and so many other cell types and tissues. That said, when we talk about fitness, what are the major types of adaptations that underlie this thing that we call fitness? And later, I know we're going to get into how different forms of exercise can trigger different types of adaptations, but what are the major adaptations that one can create in their body using exercise? ANDY GALPIN: There are many reasons why one should exercise, and we could perhaps cover that later in our chats. But the physiological adaptations can be bucketed really in a nine areas. So the very first one is what I call skill or technique. So just learning to move better, more efficiently with a specific position and timing and sequence, or whatever that is. This could be running more effectively, this could be practicing a skill like shooting a ball or an implement, swinging a golf club. Anything like that, I call that skill development. The second one is speed, so this is simply moving at a higher velocity or with a better rate of acceleration. That's very similar to the next one, which is power. And power is speed multiplied by force. The next one then, of course, on top of that, is force or strength. So those are really synonymous terms. How effectively can you move something? Now, this is often confused-- strength, rather-- as muscular endurance. So what I mean by that is strength truly is a marker of what's the maximum thing you can move or what's the maximum amount of force you can produce one time. It's not how many repetitions in a row you can do. That's actually another one of our adaptations called muscular endurance. So that is typically under the order of say five to 25, maybe 50 repetitions. Think of a classic how many push-ups can you do in a row? How many sit-ups can you do in a minute? Things like that are muscular endurance. Muscular endurance tends to be localized, so this is specific to just, say, your triceps and your deltoids. It's not a overall cardiovascular endurance marker or anything like that. So that's strength, number four. Number five is muscle hypertrophy. And this is the first time now we're talking about an appearance rather than a functional outcome. So moving better, moving faster, and moving heavier are indicators of how well you can move. This is the first one that's just simply how big is your muscle? And that's muscle hypertrophy or muscle size. After that is muscular endurance. So this is how many repetitions you can typically do of a movement. So think of how many push ups in a row you can do, how many sit ups in a minute you can do, things that are typically in five to 50 repetition sort of range. And it is often or it is almost always local muscle. So what I mean by that is a push-up test is really how many reps that your triceps and pecs and deltoids can do. It is not a cardiovascular endurance. It is not a global physiological endurance. It's specific to, typically, one or a few muscle groups at a time. And this is why you have to do multiple tests for every group there. After that, now we've moved into number seven, which is what I call anaerobic capacity. This is more synonymous with maximum heart rate. And now we're actually looking at, rather than a single movement or muscle group, it is a total physiological limitation. So it is the maximum amount of work you can do in, say, 30 to 45 seconds, maybe even up to 120 seconds, of all-out work. Think of your classic interval type of stuff here. So how much work can you do at a maximum rate, where you're going to enter tremendous amounts of global fatigue? The next past that is maximal aerobic capacity. And this is probably actually something like in the eight to 15 minute range, where you're going to reach probably both a maximum heart rate as well as a true VO2 max, which we'll talk a lot more about what that is later. So that is different from the previous one, where you can't reach this in a matter of seconds. It simply takes multiple minutes to get to a position to where your VO2 max is actually going to be sufficiently challenged or an indicator there. And then the last one, number nine, is what I call long duration. And this is just your ability to sustain submaximum work for a long period of time with no breaks, no reduction whatsoever. This is often called steady state training or a lot of people just think of this when they think of, quote, unquote, \"cardio,\" but your ability to continue to move without any breaks or change or drop is the last and final adaptation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And for long distance steady state, I'm guessing it exceeds 15 minutes because-- ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --the previous one was eight to 15 minutes or so. What sort of rate ranges are we talking about in terms of this long duration? ANDY GALPIN: Well, that's actually wonderful. You're going to be anything past 15 minutes. So really, if you look at a minimal number there, it's generally 20 minutes of what we're looking for, but a more typical would be 20 to 60 minutes. But anything past that would still be limited by your long-duration endurance, so your ability to sustain work over time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So given that there are nine different major adaptations that can be induced with exercise of specific types, is there any one global test or assessment that people can take or do that allows them to determine what level of ability, of fitness they have in each and every one of these nine different categories? ANDY GALPIN: There are probably dozens or more tests that you can do for each one of those nine categories. And what I would actually like to do is walk you through my favorites for each and giving you both the scientific gold standard-- so if you have the ability, unlimited resources, what should you go do? As well as some that are equipment-free, that are cost-free, things that anyone can do across the world. In addition to that, I want to walk you through what those numbers should be, how do you identify if you're really poor in something or if you're great. And then if you aren't as good, maybe, in a category and you want to get better at it, exactly what to do in terms of protocols for how to achieve optimal results in each of those steps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I noticed in your list of the nine different adaptations to exercise that you did not mention fat loss or health-promoting benefits, which are two reasons that a lot of people exercise. Was there a specific reason that you did not mention those? ANDY GALPIN: Absolutely. It's because those things are actually not specific training styles. They are byproducts of these nine. So what I mean by that is if you understand how fat loss occurs, which we can certainly talk about, you'll realize some of these nine protocols are effective for fat loss and some are not. General health is the same thing. When we understand what it actually means to be healthy from a physiological perspective, then the rationale for what to train for is going to determine itself. So what I mean is, looking at things like, in order to be healthy, you have to have sufficient strength, you have to have cardiovascular fitness, and you have to have sufficient muscle and et cetera. Therefore, training for one's health is determined by those restrictions. So for you, Andrew, you may need to do more strength training to be healthy, where me, because I'm strong already, way stronger than you, I may not need to do as much strength training. So our, quote, unquote, \"health-based protocols\" are based on our current status or limitations in physical fitness among these nine areas. So what I would like to do today is to cover a brief history of exercise science. And the reason is it's going to explain a lot about why people are not getting the goals in their exercise programs that they want as well as gives you very specific direction about what to do instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I can't wait to hear all the things that I'm doing incorrectly and to have you help me remedy that. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is also separate from Dr. Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton. It is, however, part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Momentous. Momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering with Momentous for several important reasons. First of all, as I mentioned, their supplements are of extremely high quality. Second of all, their supplements are generally in single-ingredient formulations. If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol, you're going to want to focus mainly on using single-ingredient formulations. With single-ingredient formulations, you can devise the most logical and effective and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals. In addition, Momentous supplements ship internationally. And this is, of course, important because we realize that many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners reside outside the United States. If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the Huberman Lab podcast, in particular supplements, for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus, as well as a number of other things, including exercise recovery, you can go to livemomentous-- spelled O-U-S-. So that's livemomentous.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolytes sodium, magnesium, and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental and physical performance. Most people realize that hydration is key. We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best, but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells, and nerve cells, neurons in particular, requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium be present in the correct ratios. Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake, but what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise, and, in particular, if you're following a very clean diet, that is not a lot of processed foods, which, of course, is a good thing, chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance. LMNT contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams-- that's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drink LMNT-- that's drinklmnt.com/huberman to get a free LMNT sample pack. With your purchase.

Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep-tracking capacity. I've been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I'm sleeping about the same amount, but I'm sleeping far deeper, and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so-called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, and slow-wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically. The underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward. I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature, that is, in order to fall asleep at night, your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees in terms of core body temperature. And waking up involves a one to three degree increase in core body temperature. With Eight Sleep mattress covers, you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night, a different temperature in the middle of the night, and a different temperature as you approach morning, each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever. If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman and check out their pod three cover and save $150 at checkout.

Before we get into how the history of exercise science informs the mistakes that we are all making and how to remedy those mistakes, I'm curious as to whether or not you have any favorite one or two studies that point to a naturally occurring example of how people can become very fit in one area and not another. I'm familiar with seeing endurance athletes that apparently have terrific endurance but, at least to my eye, don't look like they are particularly strong. I'm also familiar with seeing individuals that are very, very strong, particularly on social media, but that don't look like they could walk up a flight of stairs, much less run a mile. Do you have any examples of studies in or outside the laboratory that point to that in a concrete way? ANDY GALPIN: There's a lot to discuss here, but I'll answer really clear. If you look across the literature-- and this is actually back to as early as the mid 1950s. In fact, it actually goes back previous to that, to the Harvard Fatigue Lab, 1927 to 1947 area. People actually were advocating, at that point, a combination of strength training and endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In the 1920s? ANDY GALPIN: Way back then. In fact, it actually goes prior to that. In the late 1880s, there is scientific evidence back then. It became more well-developed in the mid 1950s and '60s. In fact, there was the initial stages of what's called the Exercise As Medicine Movement, which is the movement now, but the initial stages of that actually route back to the 1950s. And I could actually go into that whole discussion and the story of how that all came about, but that's the Health Is Wealth mantra that came from the 1950s, from the scientific community then. All those data points are going to suggest you need a combination of some sort of broad strength training and broad endurance. Now, if you have a specific goal five months from now, you want to compete in a race or hit a certain physique thing, that's fine to focus on one area of training. Certainly, if you're an athlete, that's different. But if you want to maximize health and overall functionality throughout time, it needs to be a combination. And to really, really highlight this, I can actually talk about a couple of studies that I've done. One of them we actually did in Stockholm, Sweden. So I did this at the Karolinska Institute, which you probably are aware of. It's actually one of the founding places of all of exercise physiology. Generally, it started there. It was called something different back then, but really, our entire field came out of Stockholm and the Karolinska Institute. And we worked with a whole bunch of cross-country skiers that were in their 80s and 90s. And so they were competitive skiers in the 1940s and '50s, and they had been skiing competitively for that entire duration. So you're talking 50 to 60 consecutive years of competing. So these are 80 to 90-year-olds, living alone and healthy. And we compared them to a group of individuals here in America who are the same age but were not exercising. And what we wanted to do is to see and of look at, what are these lifelong endurance individuals? What do they look like? And when we brought them into the lab, which is, by the way, amazing, to do a VO2 max test on a 92-year-old, especially in a language that they don't speak, you can imagine, you're doing this in the hospital. And you're running people through, this is a cycling task. And so for a VO2 max test, you have a mask on your face, you're hooked up to a metabolic cart so we can collect all the gases that are coming out of your mouth, and you're chanting these people on. And basically, every minute, the workload gets harder and harder and harder until you can't complete it. And we're doing this in a cardiology center, and the cardiologists are usually waiting for their heart rate to get slightly elevated and they stop them because they're 85, 86 years old. And not only are we not stopping them, but we are screaming in their ears, just go, go, go. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In Swedish or English? ANDY GALPIN: In English. And then the translator-- but it doesn't take a lot of translation when someone's screaming at your face, go, go, go. So we ran them through a whole bunch of VO2 max tests. And we did the same thing for those folks back here in America. And what was incredibly clear from that study was the VO2 max-- you can think about these numbers, and this is what's called relative. And the relative terms are milliliters per kilogram per minute. And so a standard number is about 18, is what we call the line of independence. So if your VO2 max is below 18 milliliters per kilogram per minute, it's very hard for you to live by yourself. So your fitness is so low, you probably are going to need to have somebody living with you or you'll need to be in some sort of assisted living home. So if you are in a VO2 max of 20 or 21 or 22, you're not below that line of independence, but you're on that threshold. And so what we found was our folks here in America, the group average was right around that number. So they were living at home, by definition. We picked them to be people living by themselves in their 80s and not in a living home, but they didn't have any bandwidth. So if they got a cold or they had anything pop up where they lost a little bit of fitness, they were going to drop below that line and would probably have to go to some sort of assisted living situation. The folks in Stockholm, the cross-country skiers, the group average was much closer to 35 to 38 milliliters per kilogram per minute. Now, that number is about the VO2 max you would find for a normal college male. And so these folks that were literally 80 or 90-- the joke, if a sabertooth tiger ran in the room or whatever and it chased it down and we all had to run to see who didn't get eaten alive, the college men would probably have gotten eaten before the 90-year-olds. And in one case, we had a 92-year-old individual. And I think his VO2 max was 38, which was, in our estimation, a world record, the highest VO2 max for somebody over the age of 90. ANDREW HUBERMAN: May I ask what is the typical resting heart rate for somebody very fit, like these older Swedish cross-country skiers? If somebody has-- let's say their number is 35 millimeters per kilogram in this VO2 max test, but since most of us don't have access to that kind of equipment, but we can measure our pulse rate. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What was a typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate? ANDY GALPIN: Sub 60. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sub 60. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. I mean, typically that's a good number to go off of for anybody, regardless of age. Any time I see somebody above that, I'm going to start asking questions. Certainly above-- you'll see in the literature people will say 60 to 80 is normal, and I don't agree with that at all. If your resting heart rate is 75 beats per minute, there's either something going on or you're not fit. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How much cross-country skiing were they doing, on average, in the previous, let's say, if we take the previous 20 years since they'd been longtime cross-country skiers. Divide that by 20 years. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, ANDREW HUBERMAN: On average, are these people cross-country skiing five hours a day, two hours a day, an hour a day? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, that's actually a good question. I don't remember. It's been many years, but they were not doing it every single day. And the volume would not have shocked you. It was the consistency over 50 years that got them there. Now, obviously, these people were, again, world champions and Olympic gold medalists in the 1940s and '50s, so they were elite. They just continued consistently over time, but it wasn't a shocking amount of physical fitness. They also didn't go out of their way to train hard. They were busy chopping wood. They were busy doing a number of other things. And then they just happened to do some of these races and ski along the way, but it wasn't a crazy amount too where you're like, oh, that's great, but I could never hit that number. It was something much more reasonable. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So is the takeaway to be consistent about getting cardiovascular exercise? And we can define what \"consistent\" means in terms of days per week a little bit later, and I know we will. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What are some other examples? I love these examples from the real world. ANDY GALPIN: So here's the downside, though. So I only told you about the VO2 max. What I didn't tell you about is their leg strength and functionality. And that part was no more superior than it was their counterparts who were not exercisers. So what that showed really, really clearly-- and many other studies have been done since then that look at the classic, what we call lifelong endurance exercisers. You will see, in general, their VO2 max, their cardiovascular function, their resting heart rate, their blood pressure. It will be markedly healthier than folks who don't exercise. It is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise is very important for chronic disease management, no doubt about it. However, it is not sufficient for overall global health because it does almost nothing for leg strength, for any other marker of health, which we can talk about, what are the things that are actually going to predict mortality, morbidity than most. So was a big smashing indication that's like, hey, this is great. However, you're leaving things on the table for your overall health. Now, one could argue, they're 80, and they're doing pretty well, but they weren't doing as well in these areas. And so a study we did later, actually, as a follow-up was looking at monozygous twins. So this is actually interesting. Being a scientist, this is a classic example of one of my graduate students who had been in my lab for probably three or four years. And she was in our single fiber physiology lab. And you can imagine, she's isolating individual muscle fibers, from an athlete, one by one with a tweezer. And she's going to do several thousand individual cells. So you're down there for hours, and things happen down there. You kind of lose your mind. And she was going on one day with one of my colleagues and just talking, and she's like, oh yeah, my uncle is really, really fit and something or other and then. Oh yeah, he's a twin. And I was like, oh, is he a monozygous? And she's like, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: For those that don't know, monozygous are identical twins. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, which is interesting. So you basically have-- what I'm setting up here is this is the perfect exercise scientific experiment. Monozygous, identical twins mean they have the exact same DNA. So an egg was fertilized, split, and then two humans grew out of that with the exact same DNA. And so now we can start answering the question, well, yeah, OK. What about, maybe, these cross-country skiers? Maybe they were just genetic freaks. Maybe it didn't matter. It's like some people have-- well, genetics are always a component to it, but how much? Well, now we have a scenario lining up where it's like, wait a minute. You have monozygous twins. So we have a replica of a human being, exact same DNA. The only differences that we would see in their physiology now would be due to lifestyle circumstances. Interesting. So monozygous twin dad and uncle, right? Uh-huh. Great. Do they exercise? Well, one of them does. He's a lifelong endurance exercise, runner, cyclist, swimmer, Ironman, all these things. What about the other one? Nope. He doesn't exercise at all. And at that point, I wanted to kill my graduate student because I'm like, you've been in my lab for three years or more, probably, and you've never told me that in your household is the perfect scientific experiment for exercise you could ever create. And Jesus, the look on her face when my colleague and I were staring at her. She's just like, oh my god. So I'm like, call them right now. They are coming into the lab. Fly them in from Chicago. I don't care what we have to do. We're getting them in. And so I wanted to-- actually, going back to the model that was first developed by the Harvard Fatigue Lab, one thing that's interesting about that community is they started off with the concept of trying to examine human performance through a holistic lens. And so it was the antithesis of looking at either organ by organ, so we're going to only look at the cardiovascular system. We're only going to look at skeletal muscle. And then we're saying, we're looking at this entire picture. And so that model, we wanted to carry through in these twins. And I said, all right, I want to bring them in the lab, but I'm not just going to look at one system. I want to do everything. So we took stool samples. We took blood. We did vertical jump tests. We did maximum strength tests. We did MRIs of muscle mass. We did VO2 max tests. We did efficiency stuff. We did genetic testing. We did an IQ test. We did psychological battery. We wanted to look at everything to figure out of these things, what differ between the twins? And if so, the second key question there is, by how much? So can I improve my VO2 max? Sure. Everyone knows that, but how much? Can it change by 5%, 80%? Where is the number? And so putting some quantification on this was very important. And so again, we had another example of a classic endurance-only training paradigm compared to a non. So this is a person who's, I think, he's truck driver by vocation. I think, actually, he drove for a potato chip company, which was even funnier. The endurance athlete actually was great because, like any endurance people, he had physical books of all of his training mileage for the last 35 years. And we just went through them, and we calculated the total amount of miles he ran, his averages, his heart rates per time. We had this unbelievable thing, what races he was in. He had the documentation. He was just totally nuts, something that endurance people are like shaking their head right now going, oh, yeah. I got that too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And endurance folks are pretty nerdy. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Super nerdy, right? So it was great because now we could validate, as close as one could, to actually how much you ran and things like that. So they had about a 35-year discord. They both exercised up through high school. About 18, they stopped doing it, and by the time I got them in the lab, they're in their mid-50s. So it was about 35 years of difference. And when we ran them through the testing, if you look at the measures that were similar to the Sweden study, it was almost identical. The exercising twin was significantly better at things like a lipid panel, resting heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max. Any of those markers, as predicted, were much better. What was very interesting, though, was the things that were in the middle. First of all, their total amount of muscle mass was almost identical, to the gram, within the margin of error of a DEXA scan could possibly ever be. The non-exerciser, though, was a little bit fatter. So the difference in actual body weight was explained almost entirely by body fat or non-lean tissue, really, same sort of deal. So OK. No one's surprised there that the exerciser was a little bit leaner, even though it didn't change total amount of muscle mass at all. When we looked at some of the more functional tests and we looked at things like muscle quality-- so this is a metric you can get from an ultrasound. You can kind of think about this as how much fat is inside the tissue, which is sometimes an advantage for an endurance athlete to have a little bit more of what are called intramuscular triglycerides because it's a fuel directly in the tissue. But in general, the muscle quality he was not in favor of the exerciser. If you looked at the performance testing and if you looked at strength, it favored the non-exerciser. And so now, again, we have the same finding we saw in our Sweden study, but in identical twins. And so it really, really highlighted the fact that if you want to move forward with optimal health, simply picking one silo is not going to get you there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: One silo meaning just running, just cycling? ANDY GALPIN: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Does this mean that the twin that did not exercise could jump higher or win an arm wrestling competition? Not that that's a vital thing to be able to do, but just in terms of measuring strength, it's our isometric strength. Was the non-exercising twin stronger or at least as strong as their exercising twin? ANDY GALPIN: Yes, particularly in grip strength. Yeah. And any of the measures like the vertical jump, leg extension power, and a number of things, they often favored the non-exerciser, which you're still a little bit of a chicken and egg. You don't know if, necessarily, the endurance training reduced that other twin's strength. It doesn't even really matter, per se. I think the highlight of it is, can you change some of these metrics of VO2 max? Yeah, not even close. These things are very responsive regardless of your genetics. Your genetics will give you a starting place very clearly. Even the non-exerciser was a pretty healthy guy. So they were in a good spot. Mid-50s, doesn't exercise, doesn't really pay attention to his diet at all, and he was in a pretty good shape. However, if you want to actually move progress and move forward high functionality, you have to do something besides just run, just distance run. Now, I could say the same thing for strength training. That alone-- because I don't want to make this thing like I'm saying endurance exercises. It worked. In both cases, both these studies, those folks were much better off in metrics that are incredibly important to mortality, how long you're going to live, VO2 max, et cetera. It's just not going to get there in terms of strength. We took a look at muscle fiber physiology as well, which is very interesting. So what I mean is there's generally two types of muscle fibers, fast-twitch and slow-twitch. And one of the things that is a hallmark of aging is a selective reduction in fast-twitch fibers. And that's because it's difficult to activate them unless you're doing high-force activities. You're going to activate slow-twitch fibers doing almost any activity of daily living. And so they stay around. Fast-twitch fibers, unless you're doing something of high force or going, not be used. And they're not going to be kept around. And that's a problem because when you look at things like the need for leg strength through aging, the ability to catch yourself from a fall, these things are incredibly important. If you don't have fast-twitch fibers, you don't have the speed to get your foot out in front of you on time, and you don't have the eccentric strength to stop the fall from happening. And so if you look across, again, the aging literature, they're very clear about the importance of maintaining strength and fast-twitch fibers over time. So we know that this is an important distinction here overall. And people will often talk about, how much of that is genetically determined? Can I change my fiber type? And the answer there is resoundingly yes. And can I change it with exercise? And the answer is, absolutely you can. And then the next question is, how much? So now, again, we're going to see an order of magnitude. In general, without going too far down an area that maybe we can save for later, each one of your muscles in your body has a different percentage of fast-twitch and slow-twitch, for example, your calf. If you look at your soleus, which is the smaller one that goes in the back, that's generally mostly slow-twitch, typically 80% or so slow-twitch. The gastroc, which is the other one right next to it. So if you were to point your toe next to your face and that part that kind of flexes out in the middle pops out, that's your gastroc. That is almost the inverse. So it's generally 80% fast-twitch, maybe 20% slow-twitch. Generally, anything anti postural or postural, rather, anti gravity, spinal erectors, things that are meant to keep you up or moving all day, are going to be slow-twitch. And things like your hamstrings, which are for explosion, are going to be fast-twitch. Well, we biopsied the quad in these individuals. And in that muscle, it's generally about 50/50, fast-twitch, slow-twitch, as a really broad number. Well, one of the things that we found was in the non-exerciser, it was almost textbook what you would predict. It was about 50% or so slow-twitch, a little bit of percentage of fast-twitch, and then about 20% or what are these called hybrid fibers, which are a hallmark of an activity. All right. Great. In the exerciser, it was about 95% slow-twitch. And so it's extremely clear-- again, I don't know if maybe their set point was a little bit higher towards that, and the non-exerciser devolved down to his place or the other one, but it doesn't matter. I mean, you're going from 40% slow-twitch in one case to 95% slow-twitch in another case. It shows you that the limits of physiological adaptation are darn near boundless given enough exposure. In this case, 35 years of extremely consistent training, and his muscle morphology was completely different than his identical twin with the exact same DNA. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those are two beautiful examples of people doing endurance work for a number of years and what that gives them in terms of benefits and functionality. Has the opposite experiment been done or observed, where somebody's just weight lifted or just sprinted for a number of years? I don't know that there's a identical twin control. That's a little-- ANDY GALPIN: No. I wish we had a third twin. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --too much to ask for. Right, triplets. So triplets out there, if you're exercising in different ways or people who have triplets, maybe you assign one kid to be a runner, one kid to be a weightlifter, and the other one to be sedentary. Please don't do experiments like that. But the expectation, as I understand it, would be that the person that sprints or that does heavy squats, explosive work, would then have more fast-twitch muscle fibers in their quad. And their non-exercising counterpart would have fewer. That would make sense. But what happens if you assess the endurance level in somebody who's just done strength training or just sprinted? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. So we don't have those data specifically. We're actually just starting to have studies come out on lifelong strength trainers. And there's actually a very good reason for this, which is a whole story we can get into, but the quick answer is, we don't have a lot of people who've been lifting weights for 30-plus years. We have a whole swath of people who've been doing endurance training for that long. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that because fewer people have been weight training or are the weight trainers all dead? ANDY GALPIN: You've got to go back to 1953, 1954. You had two major things happen that changed the entire course of exercise physiology and exercise science and, really, exercise as we know it. It's important to understand the history of our field. A lot of the questions I get are based on false assumptions of what exercise can and can't do. As an example, questions like momentum. Should I use momentum or that's cheating, right? Or it doesn't work. It compromises my results. It's actually totally untrue. There are excellent reasons when you should use momentum when you lift. There are reasons when you should not. It is sometimes very beneficial to go fast with the exercise repetitions. Sometimes very slow and controlled is better. Any question I get-- in fact, I'm very infamous for always responding with, \"It depends.\" The reason I say it depends is it depends on the goal. When you're training for speed or power or muscular endurance, the answer to some of these very common question differs. What people fail to realize is they think they're asking the right question because they don't understand this history, what's being planted in your brain subconsciously, is driving that question. And it's not necessarily the right one. So if we walk through that a little bit, you'll see what that field has led. Why you think certain things matter when they actually don't or maybe your assumptions are incorrect and then exactly what to do about them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a vitamin, mineral, probiotic, and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my foundational nutritional needs. That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals, and the probiotics are especially important to me. Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens, which are critical for recovering from stress, from exercise, from work, or just general life. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d3k2. Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim this special offer. ANDY GALPIN: So in 1953, 1954, you had Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute mile, so subfour-minute mile. And then you also had Sir Edmund Hillary and then his sherpa, Norgay, summit Everest in the same, basically, two-year span. That exact same year after that was the formation of what's called the American College of Sports Medicine. Now, that is still around today. It is the preeminent group for this Exercise As Medicine. So if you're interested in things like exercise for obesity prevention, for cancer treatment, for things like that-- it's not really sports medicine. It's more for clinical exercise-- that's the place to go, American College of Sports Medicine. So we have this launching of both a ton of people wanting to start doing endurance exercise and start swimming and cycling and running. And then you have a launch of people coming off of the back of the Harvard Fatigue Lab. So the fatigue lab actually shut down in 1947. So you have these people interested in physical fitness, but nowhere to go. Well, all those people left the Harvard fatigue. lab and started their own labs at other places. So you've launched the careers of people like Dave Costill and John Holloszy and some of these very famous exercise physiologists. And they start building laboratories. And we start, for the first time ever, studying the science of exercise. So years go by, and these people happen. The 1960s the 1970s is what we call the runner's boom. So people start-- in fact, if you look at the numbers of people who are doing marathons, it explodes through these two-decade spans because it's like, we could do these endurance feats. Notice both those feats were endurance, running short term as well as going over there. No one has thought anything about strength training and here's why. In the late 1880s, there was a very famous physician named-- George Winship, I think was his name, who was a big proponent of strength training. Well, he died in the age of 50 something of a heart attack. And that terrified people of strength training for 70 years because they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. That stuff will kill you because he was a doctor, he was trying-- he was running around the country, doing these exhibitions and reporting it, and then he died. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's sort of like Atkins-- ANDY GALPIN: 100%. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --dying. Although some people say he died of a heart attack. Other people said he fell through the ice into cold water. That's debated, but the fact that a heavy proponent of a given nutrition plan dies suddenly. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not good for business. ANDY GALPIN: So now the little storm is brewing. 1940s-- and I'm going back a little bit, but bear with me for a second-- there's a guy named Peter Karpovich, and he's a scientist out of Springfield, the decorated physical education, PE, that's a legendary place, Springfield College. And he is anti strength training for a lot of the same reasons. In his entire career, he talked about, don't do this. He's the one that launched these ideas that strength training will make you lose flexibility, it will be bad for kids, all these things that we know now are clearly not true. He's a proponent of these things. And there is a show that happened at Springfield College, and a guy named Bob York-- and if you-- York Barbell, that's still around today-- is going around the country and putting on these exhibitions. They come to Springfield, and it's sort of like a new-age social media thing, where it's like, the students know what's about to happen because Karpovich shows up to this event. And everyone knows he hates strength training. And everyone is like waiting for it to end, just to see what he's going to say. So this whole exhibition goes on, and these people are doing-- you've got to remember back at the time, bodybuilding, weightlifting, power lifting, strength, strongman, it's all the same thing. There's no differentiation yet. And it finishes, and Karpovich stands up, and the crowd goes silent. And he just asks one question. And he just points to one of the guys and says, scratch your back. And now he's just assuming and waiting for the guy to be like, ah and not be able to put his hand behind his head. And I think he pointed to John Grimek, who's a famous bodybuilder. And he reached back and scratched his back, no problem. And then they proceeded to grab two dumbbells-- I think they were 50-pounds dumbbells-- and do a backflip, standing backflip with both in each hand. They started doing the splits on stage, and they start performing all kinds of physical function tests. And Karpovich is stunned. He's like, holy-- he has nothing to say. He leaves there, and his whole life has changed. All these things he was claiming were shown, in his face, to be false. He does a 180 on his career. He starts running study after study on strength training and starts finding immediately there are no detriments to strength training in terms of global health. Of course, you can do it wrong and things like that. And in fact, here comes a whole bunch of benefits. So through the 1950s, while this thing is going on with the endurance folks, no one's still strength training because there's no record to see. There's no American College of Sports Medicine. There's no societies. There's no science. We're not sure it's safe. And meanwhile, Karpovich is just hammering study after study after study showing you it's safe, it's safe, is safe, but it hasn't picked up yet. And then everything changed in 1977. Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He came out with the trifold. He hits you with pumping iron, which I know you know that movie, right? Pumping Iron. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's an interesting movie. Even for those not interested in bodybuilding, it's a very interesting movie because it really gives a window into not just him, but the way in which weight training started to show up as a regular practice. When I was growing up, the only people who weight trained were people preparing for football, bodybuilders, who basically didn't exist in the town where I grew up. And the only people who did yoga were yogis doing Bikram, but now you drive through any major American city or European city and there is yoga studios, there's gyms with free weights. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arnold Schwarzenegger is largely responsible, I think, for initiating that shift. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. Because think about it. He hit us with Pumping Iron, Conan, and then The Terminator, almost in back-to-back-- very close, within years. So you've got this whole cascade of the '70s of people running, cycling, and swimming. Now, science is starting to come out that it's not dangerous and maybe, actually, some benefit. And then boom. Not only is it not bad for you, it can make you into a real world superhero. I mean, think about the psychology of a child growing up, watching somebody like Conan. Think about what Batman looked like in the 1950s and '60s. And then boom. I can look like that? Now, not everyone wants to look like Arnold, but you see the power that can land in people. No one had ever seen or thought you can make your body transform like that. You could maybe be born like that, but no chance. That's within the grasp of all of you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When I was a kid growing up, one of my favorite books was The Guinness Book of World Records. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I still have images in my mind of the coldest animal. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The longest lifespan, et cetera. And there was a picture in there of Arnold Schwarzenegger. And you know what his record was? It said, perfectly developed man. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which is, as you point out, that isn't the physique that most people aspire to. ANDY GALPIN: It doesn't matter, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But it did inspire this shift. The other thing about resistance training that I think has a certain allure for some people, men and women, is that it's one of the few forms of exercise that because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscle that occurs during the training, the so-called \"pump,\" it gives you a transient but somewhat real window into what your results will be. ANDY GALPIN: 100% ANDREW HUBERMAN: When you run and you're gasping for air, you aren't experiencing what it's like to be faster than you are that day. ANDY GALPIN: That's correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But when you weight train, you get an aesthetic picture into how your functionality and aesthetic will change. It disappears a few hours later-- ANDY GALPIN: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --as the so-called \"pump\" subsides, but it's a very interesting form of exercise in that way. It's almost as if you go in to learn a language and during the process of learning, for brief moments, you're actually fluent, and then it gets taken away. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it puts the dopamine carrot out in front of you. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is just me hypothesizing as to why weight training might have taken off the way that it did. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, I mean, it's like if you got paid every hour on the hour when you were working. And then at the end of the day, They take the money back, but you still-- as the time clock is going on in your day, you're looking up, and you're watching your bank account grow in real life. You can see why it's so addicting to those folks. So to finish the story here, going back to your actual question answer. This is happening in the late '70s, early '80s. And so now Joe Wieder, all these gyms, they're exploding because people want to look like that or they realize they have the chance to change how they physically look. That had never been a reality before. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mostly men at that point, I'm guessing. ANDY GALPIN: Almost exclusively, yeah, for a large number of reasons, cultural acceptance, et cetera. Even with endurance stuff, you could get fitter and run faster and that's better, but it wasn't going to change how you looked unless you were losing fat. Now you can change how you look, which is so incredibly addicting. In fact, there's a very famous quote. I think it was actually Joe Wieder who said, \"Show me one man who wants to be strong, and I'll show you 10 who want to look strong.\" It's like, that's very, very powerful. There's this a whole-- there's tons of this history I can go into, which is sort of explaining to you. But now you know you're in the mid- '80s, and you have what I call my generation. So you have my generation, who fall in love with strength training in the 1980s and '90s, but there's really no scientific field for it. It's not really come about yet. The science of endurance and exercise physiology is now humming along at a massive rate because these people came up in the '70s and '80s, and they're five, 10, 15 years in their career. They're producing. They're generating graduate students. They're starting their own labs. And they exercise physiology, still to this day, is 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost exclusively. Well, now my generation, you love sports. You love lifting. You love all these things. And now what we see happen is the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan starts picking up strength training. Ooh. That's on TV. He's on SportsCenter in the mid 1990s, lifting weights. And we go back, actually, to the late 1970s. And I'm not sure if you're a football fan, but any football fan will recognize the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 1970s and '80s changed how football's played. Well, the reason is because they started strength training. And they started doing it with a guy named Boyd Epley, who was the founder of the NFCA. So the National Strength Conditioning Association is formed in the late 1970s as well. So just like ASCM was developed the year after those two events happened, 1978, the year after Arnold comes out, boom, NFCA is formed. And now you have a scientific organization dedicated to strength and conditioning. You've got NFL strength conditioning coaches that are starting to come on board. You've got scientists that are starting to come into labs. And strength conditioning becomes a scientific field. Well, everything swings now, from an exercise perspective, into bodybuilding. And so almost all of the things-- in fact, we were sort of talking before, I could run a whole bunch of tricks on you. And I could ask you a whole bunch of questions about things that you think are absolute standards or guarantees about training. I'm supposed to do this. I'm never supposed to do that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: For instance? ANDY GALPIN: For instance, is it OK to train a muscle group on back-to-back days? Most people are at home thinking, no, you're not supposed to train a muscle-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It needs to recover. ANDY GALPIN: And that's total nonsense. Other things like body part split training, training one muscle group per day, other things like cardio, endurance training influencing, will it ruin my gains for my lift? All of these things are on at a base of assumptions that come from bodybuilding. Now, that's a fantastic world, but because everything started in the late 1970s as bodybuilding, in terms of-- basically strength training was that. Weightlifting and powerlifting were not at all around. They were, but nobody cared. Again, show me someone who wants to be strong. I'll show you 10 who want to look strong. The physique thing just dominated, and we're not getting out of that yet. We're not all the way out of it. We're starting to, though, because here's why. People started to realize, this bodybuilding thing is fantastic. I can change my physique. I'm getting better, but damn, these workouts take an hour and a half, two hours. And I'm going to spend that whole time on one or two body parts, which means I'm going to have to lift six days a week, and I'm going to have to do that consistently. Now all of a sudden, boom. Two hours on my elbow flexors. Damn, my elbow's starting to hurt. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And yet, my understanding is that it doesn't really require two hours a day-- ANDY GALPIN: Not at all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of training in order to get benefits, even just for hypertrophy. ANDY GALPIN: Totally. But a lot of the times, you're going to have to get some amount of time in because you're spending so much isolation. So we've gone away from training movement, running as a movement, cycling as a movement, training my biceps as a muscle or muscle group, training my hamstrings or a muscle group. That's not a human movement. So we've done a 180 in terms of selecting the exercises from movement-based prescription to now muscle group-based training. So when you're isolating muscle groups, that means a whole chunk of your body is really not doing much throughout the day. So what happens if you're doing, say, legs on Monday and you miss Monday because you're on a flight? Now your legs have to wait a whole other week, So this starts to become problematic. People start getting beat up. People start realizing, I actually don't feel that great. I'm not super fit. I'm sweating just walking up the stairs. I'm out of breath. Why? Because all that training, you've done nothing for your cardiovascular fitness. You've done nothing to improve heart rate, oxygenation, blood flow. And so that paradigm swung way too hard into the exercising, especially lifting weights, is single joint, often machine, often slow, often high-volume isolation stuff. And that left a giant opening of people going, well, wait a minute. What if you could get in the gym, I can promise you the same or better result in under 30 minutes? And, in fact, you'll also feel better. You'll lose more weight. And that opened up group exercise classes, kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type of stuff, circuit training because you can come in, you won't get so beat up because the volume is lower, the time is much lower. You get multiple adaptations at the same time. Great. The problem with that, though, fast forward 10 years, is it started burying people because you've now de-emphasized movement quality, and you've overemphasized scores. So this is a classic example. If you go and you watch Pumping Iron or any bodybuilder, you'll see if they're doing a bicep curl, they don't even really pay attention to the rep range. They don't really pay attention to the load. They are looking at their muscle. They're trying to figure out, how do I get that thing to fire? They're squeezing. They're flexing. They're posing at the end of every set. They're trying to figure out, am I getting enough pumps? It is exclusively founded on exercise quality. The rep brains, the numbers, almost irrelevant. When you go to the other model, exercise technique, it doesn't matter. Just get the most amount of weight up or the amount of reps or the fastest time, et cetera, et cetera. High-intensity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This would be CrossFit. I've walked past some CrossFit. I've done two CrossFit classes. ANDY GALPIN: I don't want to get sued. So you said \"CrossFit.\" I didn't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no I enjoyed them. I definitely felt like I was working hard. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, you will. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I observed a lot of people in very close proximity doing Olympic lifts and doing kipping-- that's where you kick your legs, folks, say, sort of like bucking and kipping type pull-ups. No. I enjoyed it. It wasn't for me for the long term, but it did seem that there was a lot of ballistic movement in close proximity to other people. So the hazard to me seemed more about that than the actual movement. ANDY GALPIN: Well, again, the point I'm setting up here is, that was actually a really brilliant solution for a lot of the problems the classic bodybuilding hypertrophy introduced. So it got away from isolation movements and got people doing big movements, which are more effective, generally better. It got people doing things fast and explosive. That's more athletic. That is more important for longevity. It solved a lot of the problems. Joint health wasn't getting crashed. The issue they went with is they just pushed the pace on score rather than quality. They pushed the pace on how many people can be in here at the same time. So now you're doing higher-risk movements, higher intensity, higher fatigue, and with a total-- not that they don't care about technique, but it's not the thing that they're most concerned about. It's getting the number and the thing done. They solved the time issue, though. You can get tremendous results in three days a week, under 45 minutes each session, et cetera. Burn people out, though. Way too much high intensity, way too often. And the other problem, safety concerns, all kinds of orthopedic issues and other stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can I interrupt you for a moment and just ask a question, as we go through this arc of the history of why endurance training predominated or strength training or bodybuilding type training or CrossFit type training because I think this is fascinating, and I know we're about to arrive at where we are today-- ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --and what the future looks like for people and what they should focus on and do. At what point, if any, do you think resistance training started to become adopted by women? There was no equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger there was Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are some impressive physiques, certainly, on female actresses and athletes. The Williams sisters, very impressive musculature and physiques. And, of course, their tennis playing speaks for itself. Has that happened yet? What I mean is, do you think, since you work with both men and women, do you think that most women understand that weight training, done properly is going to be extremely beneficial for them, maybe even especially for them, in terms of offsetting bone density loss and things of that sort? Or are we still waiting for the popular stimulus for getting 80% of young women thinking, I want to lift weights? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Hard for me to answer because I'm not a woman. Now, I have a daughter. She's four, so we'll see. What I can say is, I've probably worked with-- I don't know how many professional athletes in total. A lot. I've worked with them probably 14 professional sports. I've worked with Cy Young winners, MVPs, all the credentials. I bet 35%, 40% of the athletes I've worked with are female. So I've worked with Olympic gold medalists. I've worked with bronze medallists in multiple sports. I've worked with the most decorated powerlifter of all time in a number of these areas, fighters, world championship, all of these things. For me, I feel like that burst has already happened. My students, if you look at my classroom, I don't know what the numbers are, but there is no small number of females in exercise science and excess physiology. If you look at our laboratories, that's one thing you will see. There are very few female exercise scientists. There are very few female strength conditioning coaches, but that number is coming down at an astronomical rate. You have people that are being hired in every sport. You pick the NFL. You pick Major League Baseball. Every few months we're hearing, first female hired for this, first female hired for that. The Yankees, Rachel Balkovec is fantastic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, Rachel's been out to my lab. She's terrific. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's fantastic. I mean, she's now being hired as the-- I think she's a hitting coach now, actual sport coach. She's going to be a GM. This is her goal. She's a terminator. So that's already happening. And my students that are coming through our program are getting placed in these roles. They haven't gotten through yet a lot in terms of being an actual scientist, but they're getting there. Sports scientists in the NBA are being hired, females, in terms of big data collection. And sports science and tech, we'll cover in another discussion, but I think it's happening. Whether or not the cultural and social-- I can't speak to that end of the equation. What I can speak to, though, is one of the things I think is most fun coming forward scientifically is a number of years ago, NIH came through with their mandates. They're saying, it's no longer acceptable to exclude women from scientific research because we just did that for decades. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, what happened-- just to fill this in because I think it's worth noting is that for many years, studies even on rodents were mainly carried out on male rodents because the assumption-- and the assumption turned out to be wrong-- but the assumption was that the physiology of female rodents-- because they don't have a menstrual cycle. It's not 28 days. They have an estrus cycle. It's four days, a different type of cycle-- that would somehow disrupt the data. It turns out that's entirely wrong. Now it's actually required. When you sit on a grant study panel, which are the people who evaluate grants, they ask. They literally say, did they meet the criteria for sex as a biological variable? Here we're not talking about sex as the verb. We're talking about sex as biological sex. And if you don't say yes, that's a strong hit against the grant. And if you say yes, then it checks off that box. So it's now required that both male and female rodents and humans be studied in a given study unless the study is specifically geared toward understanding that only exists in one or the other population-- ANDY GALPIN: Reproductive study, things like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --such as menopause, for instance, ANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --menstrual cycle, andropause, for instance. But no, this is extremely important. I'm excited to hear that. ANDY GALPIN: So where I was going to go with that is actually, so that was step one, which is cool. You've got to include them. Where we haven't gotten to yet, but I've seen more and more grant applications come through for this, it's just the funding hasn't it yet, which is, it's one thing to let women be in the same studies. That's great. It's another thing, though, to start performing high-performance research specifically for female questions. That has not happened yet. And that's just a funding issue. We haven't gotten money yet. People aren't supporting that. We don't get a lot of financial support for sports science, but we can't track down the money yet of me going, I want to do a study in female athletes that answers female athlete questions. These won't help men. These are questions specific to the female. That's the next step. That's where we've got to get to so we can say, maybe we should do things differently around training or recovery or we shouldn't or it doesn't matter. There's a handful of-- not lower-quality, but some studies. I don't love them yet. There just needs to be a ton of work. Birth control is a very good example the information for women at female athletes or even just hard exercisers-- you don't have to be a competitive athlete-- around what is birth control doing? What types? How should I manage that? What conversations should I be having with my doctor? Almost nothing. Women have nothing to go on for high-performance stuff. So what if I'm trying to compete in an event or run a race? All those types of questions should be answered. Normative value, normative data, performance testing. It's just not there on the female. So that's an area. I think-- if somebody really wanted to make a change, the scientists want to do it. I know it. I've talked to so many in our field that would really love to explore it because it's getting there. Like I said, the coaching side is getting there. They're seeing it. They're hiring these people. I'm seeing it in my students. My followings is not all men. It's a very large percentage of females, and all I do is post about exercise science. This is all I do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, this podcast is very-- we know very clearly the audience is 50% women, 50% men-- ANDY GALPIN: That's nice. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --which is great. ANDY GALPIN: So just to jump back in our history discussion and to finish that point of where we're at now and where I think we're going to go or should go. So we walked through the bodybuilding running everything and people walking into a gym. Any time they lift weights, they're making all of their choices based on the assumption that maximizing muscle size is the goal. And clearly, that's not the case. There are other adaptations you may be after. So we talked about how that had problems, and then we talked about how some of these other forms of exercise filled those gaps and then what problems those things introduced. Well, I think we're actually at a point where that pendulum is slowly shifting into the middle. What I mean by that is, if you want to maximize muscle strength, we look towards the power lifting community. If you want to maximize muscle power, we're going to look to the weightlifting community. If you want to look for muscular endurance, well-roundedness, maybe we look into the CrossFit communities and some of these obstacle course races or functionality things. So what we can do now is generate protocols that get us the exact adaptations we want and not ones we don't want, because we can look back at each of these different styles of training and pick and choose optimal protocols or combinations for them. So if somebody simply wants to get healthy, like we talked about when we listed the nine adaptations and I mentioned health wasn't one of them, that's because what determines your health versus what determines my optimal health differs. So if I need more hypertrophy, I can look towards bodybuilding concepts, but if I have enough or maybe for personal reasons, I decide I have too much or I don't want to add any more, then I can say, hey, how can I get stronger without getting bigger? And boom, I look towards powerlifting concepts. How can I get more powerful? How can I get faster but I don't, again, want to lose fat? OK, great. Or if I want physique changes. So we have all these different areas we can pick and choose from that have expertise in specific adaptations and develop ourselves perfect protocols based on that information. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy. They have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course, but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts, what sorts of nutritional changes, what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So with the understanding in mind as to how we all, myself included, arrived at such lopsided fitness, too much endurance, not enough strength, too much strength, not enough endurance, it's really hard to imagine that anyone's perfect in this regard. Can you walk us through the nine different adaptations that you mentioned earlier and give us a way to assess our level of ability or our level of adaptation in each of those nine? ANDY GALPIN: All right. The very first one we want to talk about is movement skill. Now, set aside sport specific. So I'm not going to give you an assessment for optimal golf technique swing. This is really about human movement so that you stay injury free and you can continue to train for as long as possible. So what are the minimum requirements? Now, if you can have access to a highly-qualified physical therapist or movement specialist, that's the best route. Go to them. Have them identify all of your movement patterns, overhead pressing, squatting, running, all these things. That's your gold standard. If you want to do it yourself, though, here is a very simple four-step solution. So the way that I teach this is I go joint by joint. And so I think of this as the major ones, your shoulder, your elbow, your low back, hip, knee, and ankle. Now, what you can do is do a representative movement for you. So if you bench a lot, use the bench. If you do pull-ups, use the pull-up. If you squat, do that. I would recommend doing an upper-body press, an upper-body pull, a lower-body press, a lower-body pull. An example would be a push-up, a pull-up, or a bent row, a squat, and then a deadlift. That would be a very, very well-rounded approach. What you're going to do is do that movement. And I would record it for yourself. And record a frontal view and a side view. Probably do three to 10 repetitions per angle, slow and controlled. You don't need any body weight. What you want to do is move, and you want to look for key things at every joint. So again, imagine I'm doing a squat. I'm going to do a squat, and I'm going to focus on just my ankle. And I'm going look for these four things of the ankle. And then I'm going to go back and watch my knee and look for these same four things of the knee through the hip, et cetera. So what are these four things? Number one is you want to look for symmetry. So symmetry is front to back, left to right, and your right limb and your left limb. And so what we want to look for are if they aren't moving perfectly, that's fine. But you want to see is one moving further ahead than the other one? Is one turning to the side and one's not? Is one fidgeting and twitching around differently? So you want to look just to check, to see and make sure that they're stable. That's one. Number two, you want to look for stability. So a key indicators here are things if you can't get through Squat, a controlled squat, where your knees don't start shaking. That would be an instability issue. So can you do the movement slow? Can you pause at the bottom, maybe three seconds, maybe five seconds or 10? You should have complete control of that movement and all of these joints. Are your hips sliding to one side when you stand up? Is one elbow closer to your body when you're benching and the other one's more flared out? These are the things I'm talking about. I'm not worried about what angle they should be at or not. You're simply looking for asymmetries or instabilities. So again, as you're pushing up, does one elbow start flipping and twitching and going all over the place? The third one is what I call awareness. So there are a lot of movement technique issues that, simply, people don't know. And so you'll watch them squat. I do this in my classes all the time. I'll have 100 kids out there, squatting. And you'll see some horrible squat technique. And then when you just tell them, hey, did you realize your heels are supposed to be on the ground all times when you squat? They're like, oh, OK. And they can correct it. It's not actually a movement flaw. It was just simply an awareness. I didn't know, and then I actually didn't realize that was happening that position. So we want all of our joints to be going through a general full range of motion, which is number four. So the ankle-- during a squat, your knees should be able to go as far over your toe as possible while maintaining good position, your feet flat on the floor, your three points of contact, your whole flat foot, and you're not compromising another joint. So that's all you're going to look for are those four things, symmetry, stability, awareness, and range of motion through each joint, through each movement. It sounds difficult and time-consuming. It's really not. You can generally clear these things in one or two repetitions in a couple of seconds. And what you're really going to look for-- there's lots of scoring schemes you can test, that physical therapists will sort of do. I just look for absolutely terrible, can't do it at all, minor flaw, or pretty close to good. That's really all I'm looking for. So my scoring system is zero, one, three. Zero is like, you're not going to do this exercise because you're at a very high acute risk. You might get hurt on rep one tomorrow. Number one, a score of one is like, there's a minor flaw here. We can probably do it, but we need to be cautious of load and volume. And the other one is, maybe it's perfect, maybe it's not, but go ahead and it on a reasonable protocol. You'll be fine. So that's generally what you would need to do as a cost-free method of identifying good movement technique within any of the things that you would do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about speed? ANDY GALPIN: I actually don't think this is one most people should test. If you're a high-performance athlete, we can run a 40-yard dash or we can do some different things with a velocity transducer on a barbell, if you're a weightlifter or something. For most people, pure speed is really maximum velocity or acceleration are the two ways we break it down. It's generally not that necessary to test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about number three, power, which I believe before you told me was speed times force. ANDY GALPIN: So the reason why I don't worry too much about speed is because you can infer a lot of it from a power test. And a power test is easier to do as well as easier to train for for most people. So the cost-free version here is a simple broad jump. So this is stand with normal position, jump out as far in front of you as you possibly can, and measure the distance between where you started and the back of your heel, where it lands. A super basic number to look for there is your height. So you should be able to broad jump how tall you are. If you're 5' 5,\" you should hit 5' 5,\" 6' 5,\" et cetera. It's not perfect. That's going to ratchet down a little bit, about 15%, for females. They just simply don't have the power, in general, that men have. And so you're going to want to bring that down a little bit, but it's a very crude number. If you were to look at a high-performance NFL player, if they're six feet tall, they're going to be jumping nine to 10 to 11 feet. If you can jump your body height-- we're not looking for optimization in this particular test. You are looking for red flags if you can jump your body height, you're going to be just fine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's incredibly straightforward and yet, I have one question. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm assuming that I can squat down as low as I need to before I jump, I can swing my arms from back to front as harder, with as much momentum as I can muster. And when I land, you said I'm going to take the measure from where the back of my heels. ANDY GALPIN: You want to measure the distance you actually covered. So to clarify, there's no running approach here. There's no steps into it. You're going to stand at a still. Yeah, you can swing, bounce as much as you'd like to do. You're going to projectile off. So you're going to measure the distance from the tip of your toe-- so basically, stand behind the line and then the furthest point back where you land. So basically, the worst possible score, not the best possible because your feet won't land symmetrically. One's probably going to be a little bit farther. Now, technically, if you fall backwards and your hand touches the ground, we mark that number, but in this case, just use the furthest point back over your back heel, and go from there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll be trying it tomorrow morning. ANDY GALPIN: Now, if you have access to a little bit more technology or you just really want to know a better number, a classic vertical jump is a good starting place. So you can actually do this in a simple, cost-free way. You can just measure two of your hands. Put them together so that both of your middle fingers are touching. Overlap them, and put them directly over your head. And then you want to reach up as high as you can get. And you mark that on the wall. My brother and I used to do this all the time. We would take a highlighter, the yellow ones, and color as much as we could on our fingertips, touch the wall so that the highlighter would stain the wall-- if you actually go back to my house from my childhood, you'll see these markers all over our house. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm sure your parents were thrilled. ANDY GALPIN: My dad didn't care. Single dad, he didn't care. He's just like, whatever, you guys. Do whatever you want. So you want to measure that. And then, of course, you're going to jump with those two hands and touch as high as you can up. And you're going to measure the distance between your standing reach and the actual height that you jumped there. Now, the reason you're doing it two-handed by the way, is because if you do one-handed, you can actually reach pretty high by offsetting your shoulders. And now you're getting into differences of who has more shoulder mobility, who has the ability to get up there. A two-handed standard approach is there. Same thing, no running approach here. You can dip. You can drive. You can do all those things. You can swing your arms, but you're going to be a two-handed touch, is a general way to do that. You want to look for a number of something like 24 inches or higher. If you're past the age of 50, that number can come down a little bit, to closer to 20. And again, for females, it's going to be ratcheted down about 15% everywhere you go. If you're a middle-aged female, and you're jumping 20 inches, you're in a pretty good spot. You're going to be looking really nice there. Now, if you can do that on a force plate, that's even better. So these are, basically, scales that will go out to multiple digits, sometimes five to nine digits past zero. And you're going to stand on these things, you're going to do the exact same test. And these are very interesting because they'll tell you not only how high you jump, but they'll tell you how much force you put in the ground. They can also tell you how long it took you-- and this is called your rate of force development-- as well as impulse and speed and a bunch of other stuff, which are important to help you understand where on the power spectrum you need to be. So you would do that in addition to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell. So a very classic thing to do would be, let's say, you're going to do a squat. And you're going to put this device on the barbell, and that's going to measure the speed at which the barbell moves. And you're going to do that at 40% of your one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, up to 100%. And that allows you to create what's called a force-velocity curve. And you can start to see at what point, when you start loading things heavy, do you start slowing down too much. And that will tell you what part of the force-velocity curve that you want to train in to optimize your power. Why that's important, a lot of people will do things like, when I'm training for power, how heavy should I lift? Well, the general answer people say is, 30% of your one-rep max, but that's actually not true at all. What's most optimal for power development-- which we'll discuss more much later-- is depending on where you're flawed in the force-velocity curve. So if you have access to technology like that, that can give you a lot more insight and information. If not, do the broad jump test or the highlighter on your fingertips and jump it up and touch the wall test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: At Andy Galpin's house. ANDY GALPIN: Hey, just come along. The walls are already messed up. Just go ahead and come up to Washington, and we'll do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic. What about strength? ANDY GALPIN: Right. So strength is really important. You need to measure this in multiple areas. And we'll start off with grip strength. So you can do this in two ways. You can buy a hand grip dynamometer. Now, these are anywhere between $20 to $100, anywhere. These actually used to be, when I was in school, hundreds of dollars. And now you can literally buy them on any website for $25. So my honest recommendation is technically, that's not cost-free. I know your whole thing about the cost-free protocols, but $25, I'm calling that basically cost-free. You can bring that in and test that. And that's just a little device where you're going to squeeze, and you're going to do it. And I would do your right hand and your left hand. You want to look for asymmetries there, but you want to look for something like-- typically, they're going to give you a value in kilograms. And you want to look for something like a minimum score here of 40 kilograms. Ideally, you're up past 60 would be a really good spot to be in. You want to make sure that there's no less than 10% variation between your left and right hand. Your non-dominant hand actually shouldn't be that much weaker in this test. So what you'll actually see, a lot of times, is the non-dominant can be oftentimes stronger because the dominant hand is more for movement precision, writing, things like that. So you want them to be close. If you are a male and you are under 40 kilograms on a hand grip dynamometer, we're going to need to train that. If you're a female, it's not that much lower, but about 35 kilograms is the cutoff point. If you're above 55, we can add it to your training, but I'm not worried about leaving it out of your training. If you're a female, if it's above 50, that's my cut off of where we want to go. So that's a fairly cheap one. Another one that you can actually do is just a dead hang. So you can hold on to any bar, ideally, one that is thin enough to where you can wrap your whole hand around it. So you don't want to be using a giant fat grip. You're going to have a false reading here. So something like going to the gym and jumping on any pull-up bar or pull-up rack. And you want to hang, and this is a simple time test. So in general, we should be able to hang for a minimum of 30 seconds is what we're looking for. 30 to 50 seconds is my good, but we could probably get better here. If you're cruising above 60 seconds, I'm generally pretty happy. This is actually a good example of when females tend to be better. Grip strength on women tends to be strong, and they can hang for quite a long time. So those standards don't really change that much for women. Now, if you are exceptionally large, this thing doesn't scale perfectly. If you're 240 pounds and even if you're lean, it's just hard to hang and hold 240 pounds. Conversely, if you're 145 pounds, even if you're unhealthy, you're going to be able to hang for a long time. It's just not that much weight to carry. So just rough numbers to start off with. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's grip strength. What about strength elsewhere in the body? ANDY GALPIN: The primary ones, you can do an upper body strength test if you would like, although it's not technically something we do very often. I'm happy to do it one at max bench press or something like that. That's great. What I'm generally more interested in is a leg extension test. And the reason I like this is, a back squat is better. A barbell back squat is-- look, that's my jam. That's my life. It's just very technically demanding, and it's challenging. You need spotters. You need comfort. A lot goes into this. So for the average person, a leg extension test is fairly standardized. You don't have to worry about technique, and people can just get into it and go. And so what you want to look for there is a couple of standards you want to hit. Again, a very simple answer here is body weight. Can you do a leg extension with your body weight? ANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition? ANDY GALPIN: One repetition. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I can answer that right now. ANDY GALPIN: Can you? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: You can't? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. I can hack squat a reasonable amount of weight, but I was on the leg extension this morning, and it was a Nautilus machine. And I certainly could not leg extension my body weight. ANDY GALPIN: Let me clarify. Were you doing a single leg? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. ANDY GALPIN: So bilateral, you can't leg extension your body weight? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. But I certainly can hamstring curl my body weight. ANDY GALPIN: OK. So we maybe have some deficiencies in our quads that we need to go after, but that's a pretty good number you want to be at. If you go up in age past age 40, every decade that can come down about 10%, and you'll still be in a pretty good slot. So if you're 50 years old and you're 170 pounds, if you can do 160, you're in a pretty good spot. And then you could just, again, take it down about 10% every decade after 40, but prior to 40, there's really no change in strength, but certainly, somebody in their 40s to 50s should be able to leg extension their body weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted. I look forward to our discussion a bit later, talking about how to build strength. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. Any of these strength tests, they don't have to be done to a technical true one-rep max. You can use what are called repetition conversion equation. So put on a load that you think is kind of close to your maximum and just do it for as many reps as you can. As long as it's under five reps total, you can then actually go online and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere, and it will tell you, OK, you did three repetitions at 200 pounds. Your one-rep max is probably 215, whatever. So there's estimate equation. So if you don't want to spend the time or you're not truly comfortable absolutely going to your true one-rep max, just get to a number that's fairly close and do as many as you can and then go on line, again, one-rep max estimator equations are everywhere. If you get past five repetitions or so, the accuracy of those equations starts going down. So don't put on something and go, oh, I did 12 reps of it and then try to figure out your one-rep max. It'll get close. You start moving past that, you're just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy. So I want to make sure whether you're doing the leg extension test or a front squat test, you don't technically have to do it in absolute one-rep max. If neither of those are an option, another one I like a lot here is simply a front squat or a goblet squat hold. So you're going to hold a weight in front of your chest. A kettlebell is great here. A dumbbell is fine here. And you want to hold about half of your body weight, go all the way to the bottom position, and try to hold that for about 45 seconds. So it's a pretty good indicator of number one, your position. It's hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load as well as core strength and low back stability. So it's a very different indicator than, say, the leg extension test, but it's a really nice one. It doesn't require many moving parts. It's more difficult than the leg extension, but it's quite a bit more functional. And it's going to give you insights into a lot more areas than just the quadriceps. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So 45 seconds down at the bottom of the squat and then returning to a standing position. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. And if you can't do the return, actually, I'm not that worried, but as long as you can hold that good position without a technical breakdown in that 45 seconds, that's a really good spot. As an intro, I want a third of your body weight for 30 seconds. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. I plan to attempt all of those strength tests very soon. What about hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: Sure. Actually, before we get into that, I want to jump back really quickly. It's important to add a couple of caveats to the strength training stuff. So there's two that I want to do. Number one, these are assuming you are technically proficient. So I don't want you to do any exercise to exhaustion or to maximum strength if you're not comfortable with your technique. So adjust these accordingly. If you're not comfortable with the front squat, do the leg extension. If you're uncomfortable with that, do something different. So we never want to utilize maximum testing if it's going to come with a consequence of serious acute injury. So that's the most important flag. The second one is, your warm-up protocol will have a huge effect on your actual results. And so whenever you do these tests, especially if you're going to do a test and then a test again down the line, you want to make sure that warm-up protocol is standardized. Now, again, the NFCA-- and I can give you resources-- has specific guides for exactly what to do for your warm-up protocol prior to one-rep max testing. So we can go there, and you can look that stuff up. We can add that to show notes or something. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. And I think when we get into a deeper discussion about strength and hypertrophy and resistance training in general, maybe we could touch into the best warm-up protocol. I know I have mine, and I'm certain it's going to be suboptimal based on everything-- ANDY GALPIN: Maybe that's causing the problems. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --based on every conversation we've ever had, where I learned all the things I'm doing incorrectly. But I do make changes on the basis of what you tell me. ANDY GALPIN: It's not incorrectly so much as it is suboptimal. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a very kind way of telling me it's incorrect. Thank you. What about hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: So the thing you want to pay attention to here is, you have the aesthetic portion of hypertrophy. That's entirely up to you. There is no rationale. You can decide what you feel like looks good or doesn't look good. That's irrelevant. There is a sufficient amount you need to have, where below that, it's detrimental to your health, regardless of your outcomes. And so the best way to do this is a couple of ways. Any sort of body composition tests can do this. So whether this is a scan through like a DEXA scan, which is a gold standard or other ways of biological, bioelectrical impedance or otherwise. So there's a ton of different tests you can get that are pretty close. So what you want to pay attention to when you get a DEXA scan is a number called FFFMI. And so that stands for \"fat-free mass index.\" So you can look at again, any number of online calculators. These are all standard, so it doesn't actually matter where you pull them up. You don't have to worry about looking it up and whether or not it's right or not or something. And so that's going to actually tell you if you have sufficient muscle mass. And so a number you want to look for, in general, is something like if you're a man, your FFMI should be something like 20 or higher. If you're a woman, you want to look for something like 18. So those are the targets. If you get past 24, 25 for a man, that's a lot of muscle mass, assuming you're reasonably lean. Now, if your FFMI is like 24, 25 but your body fat is 40%, you're actually just a very, very large individual. You're not in a great spot. So when we say these sort of numbers, it's the assumption that you're probably sub 30% body fat for a man and sub 35% for a woman. So those are the numbers. There are online calculators. All you really need to know is your total body weight, your body fat percentage, and then your height. And you can enter those three numbers, and then they'll tell you your FFMI score, and it'll correct for an adjusted value. And then most of those will actually tell you the grading rubric and then they'll say, good, average, bad, et cetera, but those are the numbers we look at. If you are, as a man, sub 17, as a woman, sub 15, now we're in an area of pretty severe physiological detriment for insufficient muscle. And in some of our later discussions, we'll talk about why that matters. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's not sub 17% body fat. That says specifically, the FFMI. ANDY GALPIN: That's correct, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about muscular endurance? Is this where you're going to tell me I need to do wall sits? ANDY GALPIN: So this is really nice. You can do any number of tests here. A standard plank it is a good test of muscle endurance. So can you hold a front plank for 60 seconds? Can you hold a side plank for 45 seconds? Pretty easy. If you're able to do a push-up. So if you can't, that sort of tells you alone. It's actually interesting. If you can't do a single push-up, that's not a muscular endurance issue. That's actually now a strength issue because that's a one-rep max problem. So we want to be able to-- again, for a general male, we should have no problem doing 25 plus consecutive push-ups. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I apologize for interrupting you, but as long as we're talking about push-ups, could you just mention form? Are we talking chest touching the ground? Elbows breaking right angles? What is a proper push-up, according to your laboratory? ANDY GALPIN: Unless you have a very specific reason to limit range of motion, I want all my testing done through a full joint range of motion. This is different for the person. So it's individualized to them, but in general, for a push-up, this would be a full complete lockout of the elbows on the top and a full chest touch or close to it at the ground. You can do it different. It doesn't really matter, but just keep it standard from your pretest to your post-test if you're trying to mark progress, but for us, unless we have a very specific reason, we're going full range of motion for all of these tests. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So 25 push-ups for a male. ANDY GALPIN: 25 push-ups for a male is the standard. And even something like 10 is a number we're looking for, again, as minimum categories for an upper body muscular endurance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And not to get too down in the weeds, but I have observed other people-- of course, never myself. No, I'm kidding-- but observed other people pausing maybe at repetition 15, catching their breath and then continuing. ANDY GALPIN: That would be a fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So continue like a piston. ANDY GALPIN: That would be a fail test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So no pauses. ANDY GALPIN: Correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Just up down, up down, and trying to hit at least 10, but ideally 25. ANDY GALPIN: I learned this lesson in one of our studies, probably nine years ago, where we didn't clarify that. And so we actually had an individual-- he wasn't being nefarious. He just figured out, if I do a couple, take a quick break and do a couple, he quadrupled his post-test results from his pre-test result because he figured out that little hack. So you want to standardize it. It's not that I'm against or have some sort of strong belief. It's just trying to keep protocol standardized, which means any break, failed test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So 10 to 25 push-ups, minimum, for males. What about for females? ANDY GALPIN: So I'll clarify. If it's sub 10 for a man, that's again, and you're like, very severe red flag problem. We really, really like to see a number above 25. That's where we're anchoring. Anything between 10 and 25 is like, yeah, but not severe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It means they have work to do. ANDY GALPIN: We have work to do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And for females? ANDY GALPIN: For a female, you're going to scale that back. So a female, the answer could be as little as zero. So you're going to see that, can you do a full position? If they're in that position, we're generally not going to do a muscular endurance test from the knees. We already know the answer is you're zero. We'll actually default to another test, which I'll talk about in a second here. So for those folks, that's going to scale down a little bit. So basically, you're looking at 15 is that marker, like 25 was for the male, where I want to see above 15. And if I do, we're good. Anything between five to 15 is the number of, OK. If you're sub five, we generally have some problems. And if that is different, between one and zero, then zero is a problem. So we should be able to do that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if a female cannot do 10 full push-ups. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. 10 full push-ups hard for a female, depending on size. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Let's say a female can't do five full push-ups. You said, rather than go to a knees-down version, what would you do to assess their muscular endurance? And would you then also encourage them to work on their strength? ANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely. So again, if they can't do-- they can do anything less than three, you're going to be strength. In fact, if you want to look at muscular endurance in general-- so this is a bit of an off topic, but I promise I'll keep it short, and I'll come right back. When I was a doctoral student, I had two lab mates. One of them was a runner, a female, 120 pounds, something like that, small. The other one was a male, and he was basically like a straight bro, he lifts weights, doesn't do any other sort of training. Does a very classic not training program, but kind of training. And they were bantering back and forth for a while. And basically she was saying, you're so unfit. You can't run at all. And he's saying, you're so weak. You can't do a pull-up. And so they challenged each other to a competition. They said, at the end of the year, the girl is going to do 26 pull-ups, and the guy had to run a marathon, so 26 miles. So that was the thing. And then there was some sort of consequence for whoever failed. So the guy quickly tried to figure out, how the hell am I going to run 26 miles when I have not run a mile in many, many, many years? So he just started running, three miles, four miles, whatever. Well, of course, both of them ran immediately to me. And then she was like, how the hell? I can't do a pull-up. And I was like, great. And I gave her a very specific maximal strength protocol. And she was like, whoa. I want to go to the assisted pull-up machine and work on doing sets of 25 because I've got to get my muscular endurance up. And I tried to explain to her, your muscle endurance is irrelevant if you can't do one. It's never going to matter. She did the muscular endurance protocol, the entire thing. Didn't listen to me. The end of the year came. She still produced exactly zero pull-ups. So the point is, if you look at muscular endurance, where is it strength and where is it actually muscular endurance? The general number that you're looking for is under 80%. That's going to tell you, is this a muscular endurance problem or is it an absolute strength problem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Under 80% of a one-repetition maximum? ANDY GALPIN: Yup. So what I mean by that is this. In fact, this actually is in your question. The other way to assess muscular endurance is take the exact strength tests you did from the talk five minutes ago, which one did you do? Load that to 75%, and then do that for as many repetitions as you can. And that is a tremendous barometer of muscular endurance. So if you were able to do 200 pounds in your leg extension test, put 75% on that and do that as many reps as you can. You want to look for more than eight repetitions. If you are below eight repetitions, then we have a muscular endurance problem. If it is higher than that, if you've got 15 or 20, then we know we have probably some problems in your peak strength or the test itself. So that is a good-- eight to 12 number is where you want to be looking at for there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about anaerobic capacity? ANDY GALPIN: This one's more challenging. You either have to go to a laboratory and do something like a Wingate Test. So this is a 30-second maximal test where you're going to see how much work can you possibly do in that 30 seconds. If you don't have access to laboratory, you can do this on any protocol you want. This could be sprinting. This can be on an air bike. This could be on a rower, anything like that, anything where you can exert maximal effort and you don't have to worry about technical problems. So I generally don't like to do things like a kettlebell swing or something like that. There's just too many other variables. You need to be able to go as hard as you possibly can, knowing you're going to get to a place of tremendous fatigue. Now, in the lab, we often use what's called a Bosco Protocol. And you're going to stand on a force plate, and you're going to do as many vertical jumps as fast as you can, as high as you can, for 60 seconds. And you are absolutely destroyed by second 45. So we'll either use that Wingate Protocol or that Bosco Protocol. If you want, though, again, take any of those other places, 30 seconds or so, up to 45 seconds, up to a minute if you want, it doesn't really matter. And you just mark down the distance you cover. That's all. We don't really have standards for these things because it's going to be different. How far you can travel in 30 seconds on a treadmill is just going to be so different than sprinting in the field or on the assault bike or whatever. So what you really want to worry about there is, can you complete it? And then how awful do you feel afterwards? So what you really want to think about here is not those protocols, but this. You want to think about can you get close to your predicted maximum heart rate? So the number we throw out is 220 minus your age. So if you're 50 years old, 220 minus 50, you should be able to get to a maximum heart rate of around 170 beats per minute. Now, that number is extremely generic. If you don't get there, that doesn't have any indication of your fitness. If you get higher, that doesn't mean you're any more fit. It's just a rough number. So here's what I want you to do. In this case, your heart rate recovery is the better metric. So I want you to get up to a maximum heart rate and then test your heart rate recovery. And what you should be looking for there is about a half a beat recovery per second. So you're going to get up to a place where you reach absolute terrible exhaustion, maximum fatigue, test your heart rate, and then count. Have a timer going. Within 60 seconds, you should have, again, that half a beat per second. You should have a heart rate recovery of 30 beats per minute. Within the next minute, so two-minute recovery, it should be, again, half that, so 60 beats. Those are rough numbers to go by. And your three-minute recovery is, again, half of that again. So that is the closest way. If your heart rate recovery is worse than that, then we know we have a problem in your anaerobic capacity or your cardiovascular capacity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. What about number eight, maximal heart rate? Because what you just described sounds a lot like maximal heart rate. ANDY GALPIN: So this is your VO2 max. So the gold standard here is to actually go into a laboratory and get this thing done. So we can actually run a VO2 max test, where you put a mask on, collect all your gases, and run you to there. And there is a very specific protocol for completion of a true maximum test. And any scientist will know that. If you don't have access to that, you can do a couple of tests. One of them is called a 12-Minute Cooper's Test. So this is simply time. You're going to run for 12 minutes as far as you can, and you're going to record the distance you covered. Again, you can go online to any number of calculators, enter that distance in. And that will tell you your proximal or estimated VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's a 12-minute sprint. ANDY GALPIN: 12-minute sprint, maximum distance you can cover in 12 minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping a steady pace the whole time or going-- ANDY GALPIN: Do whatever you want. The goal is to get maximum distance covered in 12 minutes. So that's anywhere between a mile to two plus miles, depending on how fit you are, but you just do that Cooper 12-Minute Test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. ANDY GALPIN: I told you. So if you remember, aerobic capacity is eight to 12 minutes where you're going to see a real true test of that VO2 max. You simply can't get that in under a few minutes. So if you want, you can do a little gentler version of that. So there are a number of submaximal tests. In fact, there is a one-mile walk test you can do. So again, all you're going to do is-- in this case, you have to have of either a stopwatch or, ideally, a heart rate monitor. And all you have to do is-- this is a walk for one mile submaximal test. So you're going to walk a mile, record the time, record your heart rate at the end, enter those in. And those will give you, again, estimates of your VO2 max. So that's the like, oh my gosh, I can't run for 12 minutes as hard as I possibly can or I don't want to do it. We have a lot of these in our executive program. It's like, my knee hurts too bad. I've got back pain when I run or whatever. Can I-- OK. And you do the walk test. And it's pretty accurate if you do it correctly. So technically, all you have to actually do is measure your heart rate on you neck and count 60 seconds, but it's just easier to-- with everyone's watches and stuff now, just wear the heart rate monitor, plug in those numbers. And again, those are all standard calculations. So anywhere you find those, you don't have to worry about the source. So you just enter your stuff in, and they're going to be running off the same equation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I like the idea of the 12-minute run. I'm going to give it a shot, see what happens. ANDY GALPIN: For years, we did a one-mile version of this, and there's just a lot more science on the 12-Minute Cooper Test. So we did that. It's pretty good, and it is not even remotely close to fun. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It sounds like fun for other reasons. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah. Well, it is it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun in the sense that it reveals a lot. ANDY GALPIN: Yup. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's powerful, potent. ANDY GALPIN: Super. There's no hiding. You can hide with the leg extension test. It doesn't hurt that bad. But you cannot feel anything but the 12-minute \"run as far as you can\" test. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So these are really, actually, psychiatric diagnostic tests-- ANDY GALPIN: They are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --of a sort. ANDY GALPIN: For sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine, long-duration, steady-state exercise. I think of this as a.k.a. endurance, but as you mentioned before, there are other forms of endurance. So long-duration, steady-state exercise. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. So you really want to think about this as not a standard number. You should maintain consistent work output for over 20 plus minutes. And this one I want you to just pick something that it was in your lifestyle. So is there a loop around your house that you can do? Is there some protocol that you like to use before? And you're simply going to test your ability. Can you maintain work without stopping? That's all it needs to be. Now ideally, I personally like to throw a little twist in here, which is, can you do this with nasal breathing only. That's when I feel really good. If you can go 30 straight minutes without needing to take a break-- walking doesn't really cut it unless you're very, very unfit, in which case, if walking 30 minutes without a break is a challenge, OK. There. But if you can, I want you moving at a non-walking pace. I don't care what zone this is, two, three, four, five. I don't care. Show me you can maintain minimum of 20 minutes of work with no breaks, no intervals, no downtime and, again, ideally breathing through your nose only. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love this list, but it worries me a bit. Not because any one of these tests is necessarily that overwhelming, but because I'm unclear about how to arrange performance of these different tests. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: For instance, do I separate them so I'm doing one test, like long-duration output on one day and I'm doing strength on another day? Those seem pretty obvious to me, but are there ones that one can combine on different days? How much time should one give oneself in between these tests? And how often should one do an assessment? Just as we don't want to necessarily evaluate body weight changes by getting on the scale three times a day, maybe once a day at the same time each day is more practical. How often should we be assessing our fitness for each and every one of these? ANDY GALPIN: Well, the way that I would say this is, you want to pick the one that is the worst and do that more frequently. So if, for example, you do the upper body strength test and you are fantastic, if you can bench press double your body weight, I don't need to test your bench very often, for the average person. If you're not a powerlifter, maybe once a year or something. Maybe not even that. We just don't need to get there. However, if we then test your VO2 max and in your 12 minutes, you cover a total of a half a mile, then we might want to test that every month. And so we're going to let our priorities emphasize which one we're going to do more often. I would recommend doing this full battery once a year. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery, meaning the entire list on one day. ANDY GALPIN: No, not on one day, but within a week. So you could take a week. Now, you could do these, technically, all in two days. Three-day split here is probably best. So if you were to just say, hey, this is testing week. I actually love this for beginning of the year or whenever it is that you change your training, but I think once a year, just like once a year you should probably go to a physician and get full bloodwork, a full heart scan and everything like that. And then if maybe you had a heart issue, they would come back in and test you more frequently, whatever the case is. You should probably run through this. And you're going to be thinking, yeah, but I don't want to give up on my exercise routine that week. Well, I promise you, you're not going to finish this week and think, I didn't do very much work this week. It's going to feel great. And then you're going to have a very nice barometer of exactly where you need to change and prioritize your training for the next quarter or half a year or wherever you want to go. If you want to actually do this every six months, we end up, actually, doing this, quite honestly, more like every six months as a general test. That's a really good way to do it, but minimum, if you're arguing with me, give me once a year that you want to do this. So which order to do them in? The non-fatiguing tests, you can do whenever. So this is the body composition scan, the FFMI, the body fat composition. All this stuff can be done whenever. I generally like to do that, though, as your very first activity. The reason is we know that acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition measurements because of inflammation, water storage, et cetera. So it's easiest to just get that off of a 48 hour rest. You want to make sure you don't do any hard exercise the day before a body composition test and probably 48 hours before that. So just start yourself off with that. Your movement tests can be the same thing. You don't want to try to do a assessment of how well you're squatting if you're incredibly sore from your brutal squatting test. So tend to do those things when you're the most fresh. Then what you want to do is any skill or maximum strength or power goes at the very beginning of the day. And any fatiguing thing happens at the end. And so you could easily do this. All right, I'm going to do my power test, my broad jump, great. You're not going to be fatigued at all from that. And on the same day, since I'm already pretty warmed up, now I'm going to roll right into my leg strength test. And since I'm really warmed up, I'm going to do my leg muscular endurance test right there. So this is a very common strategy we use. We do our one-rep max leg extension, five minutes, seven minutes, whatever we need to do, come back, load it to 75%, do as many reps as you can. Boom. You could roll right into, then, your upper body test or your grip strength test or anything else that you want to do there. Is there a little bit of influence? Yeah, but really, for most people, it's not that bad. What influence I mean. If you do a leg strength test, coming back and doing an upper body strength test afterwards, it's not that big a deal. Give yourself 15, give yourself 20 minutes. Give it plenty of time. So you can knock out your strength testing and muscular endurance testing all in one day. You could do your performance, your skill diagnostic, your power jump test, your strength, and your muscular endurance, and all that stuff is knocked out. You're going to have to come back on a separate day and do your anaerobic tests. This is 30-seconds maximal endurance, things like that. You could, though, if you wanted, do that after your long duration tests. You're long duration test again, is just going to function as a big, warm up. Or you could flip those things or you can do them on separate days. You're going to have to do your VO2 max test on its own day, for the most part, unless you wanted to do, again, your movement or your body composition before those things. So you really have the ability to mix and match. Ideally, this most realistically probably takes three days. If you want to separate them into four or five, the more separation you do, the better data you're going to get. It's just a question of how pedantic are you really trying to get here? And are you willing to lose 5% to then save a whole day? Then you can do these things in multiple stacks. So that's how I would break it up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what I'm hearing is, better to do it than to not do it. ANDY GALPIN: Most definitely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And be rational. Don't try and do your strength output late in the day when you're fatigued. If you're going to combine some of the steady state endurance and maximal heart rate, fine. Understand there might be a slight deficit there, but test it the same way each time. And what you're really looking for is improvement. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. And you can also do the heart rate recovery under any of the modalities. So you could do the heart rate recovery after your VO2 max as well. So you finish that thing, and then just, again, do the same test for up to three minutes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: These are fantastic tools. I'm almost tempted to say that I'm willing to post my numbers, but that actually violates the core principle that I think we're getting at here, which is that it's highly unlikely that anybody is going to be phenomenal across the board. I mean, certainly there will be individuals that are, but based on everything we talked about earlier, specificity of training and how extensively somebody has been training a certain way will, without question, lop side them, if you will, toward being better in some of these assessments and less good in others. And that's just simply the way that these adaptations work. ANDY GALPIN: Yep. You don't need to be optimal in all of these areas to be, quote, unquote, \"optimal health\" from this perspective. You just want to make sure, again, there's no severe performance anchors. This is what we call them. We don't want any of these severe constraints because you're going to get limited by that thing. And so what you want to do is move that up to just sufficient or concerning and get it away from that. If you do that, that thing's not going to catch you. You're going to be able to continue to pursue optimization in any of the one things that you have a specific passion for, which is generally what moves people. You train so that you feel better. You train because you know there are all these benefits to it. And jeez, this audience probably could list hundreds of them. But you also train because you generally like to get better at something. A lot of us have something. And so you want to make sure that you're not going, hey, I know you're good at endurance, but you really shouldn't train anymore. We don't want that message, not at all. I want you to love your training. We just want to make sure that you're not loving that so much that you're not taking some blinders off and missing another area, which would actually-- again, you pull that performance anchor, this whole ship sails faster, with less effort and less friction. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I love about this is also that, as you've described it, it's not just for athletes or people that are super into fitness. It's also for people that just want to be healthy and want aesthetic changes. And that's why they're exercising, which, I think, accounts for a fairly large percentage of people out there. So I think what you described is incredibly well-structured, incredibly clear, and incredibly actionable. So I want to thank you for that I'm serious about my willingness to do this and at least share those numbers with you. And I think for most people that are seeking what you listed off before aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity, it's clear that all nine of these are going to be important in some regard or another. ANDY GALPIN: So before we close out, I want to go back and finish off the metrics for VO2 max because I don't actually think I gave you numbers on that. So in general, for men, a minimum number we want to look at here is 35 milliliters per kilogram per minute. And for women, that would be about 30. So we can actually push a lot higher on those things. In reality, I want to see men above 50. ANDREW HUBERMAN: If I could just interrupt you for a second. When you say 40 milliliters per kilogram, milliliters of what, specifically? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. So what, actually, those metrics mean is the first one, milliliters, is oxygen. So it's amount of oxygen. Kilograms is body weight. So it's, how much oxygen can you bring in per kilogram of body weight per minute? So does a volume of oxygen per your size in a time duration. In fact, the way that you calculate it is you multiply your cardiac output by what's called your a-vO2 difference. Your cardiac output is your heart rate times your stroke volume, so how much blood you're pumping out per pump is your stroke volume. How many times you're pumping or you're beating. You multiply that by your a-vO2 difference. Your a-vO2 difference is artery minus vein difference. So it's the amount of oxygen in your arteries minus the amount of oxygen in your vein, which is going to tell you how much you took up in your capillaries, in your muscles. So you take those two factors, multiply them together, and there's your VO2 max. ANDREW HUBERMAN: As you were describing that, I imagine you getting to an fMRI machine and seeing that equation lighting up in your brain because clearly, it's committed to memory very well. Thank you for that clear description. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. So to finish those numbers, I really, truly want to see a man above 50-- and I'm not even really stoked until I get above 55. In fact, it's sort of funny. Dave Costill, whose lab I did my PhD in-- he was retired by the time, but he's, again, one of these legendary figures in exercise physiology, started in the '70s. He would always say, \"There's no human excuse to be below 60,\" which I was always like, damn. That's really, actually, pretty hard to get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was he at 60 or above? ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. he's still, actually, setting world records in these last couple of years, all the Masters records for swimming and cycling and stuff. So he was a super, super fit guy. So he was always above 60. He's probably like 50 something now, even though he's 80 or whatever. ANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: With a VO2 max of 50. ANDY GALPIN: He's probably really not 50. He's probably-- but he's probably going to-- remember earlier on we talked about how I had the 92-year-old who had VO2 max of 38. Dave's probably going to break that record when he gets there, I'm sure. I'm sure. In fact, I guarantee you he has that number in his brain. I haven't talked to him in 15 years, but I guarantee you that number is in his brain, and he's probably training for it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. And I love it because it proves that exercise pays off. ANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's one of the few things in life where there's a direct relationship between work and outcome. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. As Henry Rollins described in his wonderful essay, if you're familiar with that. Oh my gosh, you're a punk rock guy. You know Henry, I'm sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, I certainly know who he is, and I know his work. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. He has incredible one-page paper. It's something to do with the iron. And he basically describes that as, this is the one thing where it's truth. It is the most true thing you'll ever do, which I love that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's almost like a principle of nature. ANDY GALPIN: 100%. Yeah. So with the women, I really want to see the women-- if I want to see men above 55, I really want to see women above 50 as the target. And if you like, you're there, I'm pretty good. So you can do the math on, then, the middle ground of what's like OK, but we need to work on it. In fact, if you look across the literature, at different athletes, you're going to see the really high-level endurance folks, they may pass 70 or 80. In fact, there was talk a few years ago of a guy breaking 100 as an 18 or 19-year-old, but I actually don't think it was ever fully confirmed or repeated, but certainly, you'll see plenty of people 95, in those extremes. If you look at other sports, like football or basketball, they're probably going to be in the 55, 65 range. So if you, as, an average person are 55, that's a really good marker to be in. If you get even close to that, you're in a good spot. I'm sorry if I let you down, Dave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. I just love how you're describing this average person, you're looking at me with just a little bit of sympathy, like if you reach the standard of average, Andrew. Listen, you're giving me prompts all over the place to try and improve my metrics, whatever they happen to be. And I think that's one of the great values of getting objective numbers, even if they have to be measured by some of these back-of-the-envelope techniques that, I guess, we always teach people in the laboratory, that a tool can be not extremely precise, but as long as it's reliable, there is still value there. I mean, of course, you'd love to have the most precise and most reliable tool, but if you can't, then at least go for a reliable tool and measure for consistency. ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. For the real world, reliability beats validity as much as we can. For a lot of the things we're talking about, especially for using it as a metric of did I get better, as long as that tool is reliable. Body composition, just all of these things have inherent error in them. Some of them are smaller, some of them are larger, but as you mentioned, having standardization within the testing protocol is going to allow you to measure progress. And that's going to tell you sort of where you're at. Now that we've covered all these areas of adaptation, we walked through the history, and we walked through a bunch of the explanations for why people are maybe not getting the results that they want to get through their training, the way I would like to go with the rest of our conversations would be to just go through each of those adaptations step by step and make sure I cover very specific protocols for, if you have run through this testing and identified an area of weakness. So maybe you've been lifting a lot because you like lifting, and you maybe realize that your cardiovascular fitness or your heart rate recovery is not where it really should be or the opposite, like we've talked about. Maybe you're doing a lot of that type of work, and your strength isn't there. Your movement quality is not there. So you've identified a problem. How do I specifically solve it? What are the evidence-based and most effective protocols that I can put myself in for each one of these categories? And I think that would give people a lot of take-home value, but it's going to take us some time to cover. So it's going to have to come across over multiple conversations between you and I. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. Well, I'm looking forward to each and all of those conversations. And I want to add just one more metric to our discussion today, which is really just my way of saying thank you because if there were a metric for amount of useful information per sentence spoke, you would be at the upper level of that metric. You have this amazing ability to provide so much knowledge in a clear and concise and, today, listed-out format that is both interesting, grounded in science, and actionable. So on behalf of everyone listening, and certainly for myself as well, I just want to say thank you. ANDY GALPIN: Well, I appreciate the compliments. And I'm looking forward to the next conversation, jumping right into speed, strength, and hypertrophy training and what are the evidence-based and best practices for protocols in those areas.

    "rawText": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology, at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Rick Rubin. Rick Rubin is credited with being one of the most creative and prolific music producers of all time. The range of artists with whom he's worked with and discovered is absolutely staggering, ranging from artists such as LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Beastie Boys, Jesus and Mary Chain, Jay-Z, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Green Day, Tom Petty, System of a Down, Joe Strummer, Kanye West, Johnny Cash, Adele, and many, many more. Not surprisingly, therefore, Rick is considered somewhat of an enigma. That is, people want to know how it is that one individual is able to extract the best creative artistry from so many different people in so many different genres of music. Well, as today's discussion reveals, Rick's expertise in the creative process extends well beyond music. In fact, our conversation takes us into the realm of what the creative process is specifically and generally across domains, including music, of course, but also writing, film, science, and essentially, all domains in which new, original thought, ideas, and production of anything becomes important. Our conversation ventures from abstract themes, such as what is creativity, and where does it stem from, to the more concrete, everyday, tool-based approaches to creativity, including those that Rick himself uses and that he's seen other people use to great success. That took us down some incredible avenues, ranging from a discussion about the subconscious, to how the subconscious interacts with our conscious mind, and how the subconscious and conscious mind interact with nature around us and within us. Indeed, our conversation got rather scientific at times, but all with an eye and an ear toward understanding the practical tools that any and all of us can use in order to access the creative process. We also spent some time talking about Rick's new book, which is all about creativity and ways to access creativity. The title of the book is The Creative Act: A Way of Being, by Rick Rubin. This is a book that I've now read three times from cover to cover, and I'm now reading it a fourth time. Because it is so rich with wisdom and information that I'm applying in multiple domains of my life, not just my work but my everyday life. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Rick has an incredible ability to translate his understanding of the creative process in a way that is meaningful for anybody. So if you're in music, if you're a musician, it will certainly be meaningful for you, but it is not about music. It is about the creative process. And so whether or not you consider yourself somebody creative or not, or whether or not you seek to be more creative, Rick's book and today's conversation sheds light on what I believe to be the fundamental features of what makes us human beings. That is what allows us, unlike other animals, to look out on the landscape around us, to examine our inner landscape, and to come up with truly novel ideas that thrill us, entertain us, entertain other people, scare us, make us laugh, make us cry. All the things that make life rich are essentially contained in the creative process. And to be able to sit down and learn from the Rick Rubin how the creative process emerges in him and his observations about how we can best emerge in others is and was truly a gift. So I'm excited to share his knowledge with you today. One thing that you'll quickly come to notice about today's conversation is that Rick is incredibly generous with his knowledge about the creative process. In fact, he very graciously, and spontaneously I should add, offered to answer your questions about creativity. So if you have questions about the creative process for Rick, please, put those in the Comment section on YouTube. And in order to make those questions a bit easier for me to find, please, put \"Question for Rick Rubin\" in capitals, then colon or dash, whichever you choose, and then put your question there. I do ask that you keep the questions relatively short, so that I can ask Rick as many of those questions as possible. We will record that conversation, and we will post it as a clip on the Huberman Lab Clips channel. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Nui, which I can confidently say is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available. Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building a USDA-certified, wild harvesting system to help balance invasive deer populations on the island of Maui. I've talked before on this podcast, and we've had guests on this podcast, that have emphasized the critical role of getting quality protein, not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis but also for repair of all tissues, including brain tissue, on a day-to-day basis. And the general rule of thumb for that is 1 gram of quality protein, per pound of body weight, per day. With Maui Nui meats, you can accomplish that very easily, and you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories, which is also critical for immediate and long-term health. I should say, that Maui Nui he meets are not only extremely high quality, but they are also delicious. I particularly like their jerky, so their venison jerky. I also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes, including ground venison, some venison steaks, and I love the taste of the venison. It's lean, but it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at all. It's incredibly delicious. So if you'd like to try Maui Nui venison, go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off your first order. Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics, and as many of you have probably heard me say before, I am not a fan of the word nootropics, because nootropics means smart drugs, and frankly, the brain doesn't work that way. The brain has neural circuits for focus. It also has neural circuits for creativity and neural circuits for task switching and for imagination and for memory. There is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart, and therefore, the word nootropics doesn't really apply to anything specific, neurobiologically speaking. Thesis understands this, and therefore, has designed custom nootropics that are tailored to your unique needs. I've been using Thesis for over a year now, and their nootropic formulas have been a game-changer for me, in particular in the realm of cognitive work. My go-to formula for when I'm doing any kind of cognitive work is their clarity formula. That's the one I've been using most often, lately. If you'd like to try Thesis customized nootropics, you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman. You'll take a brief three-minute quiz, and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month.

WHOOP is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking to provide real-time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules in order to feel and perform better. Six months ago, I started working with WHOOP as a member of their Scientific Advisory Council, as a way to help WHOOP advance their mission of unlocking human performance. And as a WHOOP user, I've experienced firsthand the health benefits of their technology. It's clear, based on quality research, that WHOOP can inform you how well you're sleeping, how to change your sleep habits, how to change your activity habits, even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition, exercise, sleep, and lifestyle in order to maximize your mental health, physical health, and performance. So whether or not you're an athlete, or you're exercising simply for health, WHOOP can really help you understand how your body functions under different conditions and how to really program your schedule, nutrition, and exercise and many other factors of your life, in order to really optimize your health and performance, including your cognition. If you're interested in trying WHOOP, you can go to join WHOOP-- spelled W-H-O-O-P-- dotcom slash Huberman. That's joinwhoop.com/huberman today, and get your first month free. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to announce that we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements, because Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality. They ship internationally, and they have single-ingredient formulations. If you'd like to access the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com/huberman. And now for my discussion with Rick Rubin. Great to have you here today, Rick. RICK RUBIN: Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So of all the topics in science, and in particular in neuroscience, I confess that creativity is the most difficult one to capture. Because you can find papers, scientific studies that is, on convergent thinking versus divergent thinking, and there are definitions to these, and they take on different forms. But in a strict definition form, it seems that creativity has something to do with either rearranging existing elements or coming up with new elements. But as I went into your book, which I've done twice. I've read it twice, and by the way, I feel so blessed and honored to have gotten an early copy from you, or a final copy early that is. But having gone through it twice, I'm now convinced that there may not actually be an internal source of creativity that exists on its own right. And the example that you give that, for me, really is serving as an anchor, and tell me if I'm wrong here, is this idea that ideas and creativity are a little bit like a cloud. If you look at it at one moment, you might think that it looks like one thing, where it has a certain shape and texture. But then you look at it a moment later, it could be quite a bit different. And if you look at it an hour later, it very well could be gone. And the reason I think that serves as such a powerful hook for me to think about creativity and why I think neuroscientists and scientists in general have never actually captured a way to even talk about creativity stems from somebody that you knew in person but, as you know, I greatly admire. I don't have many heroes, but I would put Joe Strummer among the short list of heroes that I have. And I remember once an interview with him fairly disjointed. He was off in different tangents that I couldn't follow. But at one point, he just blurted out that, if you have an idea, you have to write it down. And you may end up throwing it away, but if you wait, it will be gone. And I remember that, and as a consequence, I have a whole system that I use to try and capture ideas. But what are your thoughts on what Joe said, this cloud idea that comes up in one form in one area of the book? But then I think it's thread throughout the book in different ways. How did that come to you, and how does it serve you in trying to-- I don't want to say extract-- but trying to access creativity? RICK RUBIN: I think the best way to think about it is like a dream. It's like, if you think about your dreams, they don't necessarily make sense. When you wake up, you might remember part but not the whole thing. Then, if you start writing them down, they'll come back, and they may not make sense to you. There'll be a series of abstract images, and maybe, someday in the future, you'll be able to look back and understand what they mean, and maybe not. And that's how the art making process works is like we're making things, and we're looking for feeling in ourselves. And it could be a feeling of excitement or enthusiasm, a feeling of interest, a feeling of curiosity-- I want to know more-- a feeling of leaning forward. And we're following that energy in our body, when we feel there's something here. There's something here. I want to know more. I want to know more. I want to know more. I'll say, it's not an intellectual process. It's a different thing. That's why it's hard even to talk about it, because it's so elusive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Recently, I was listening to a podcast by our friend Lex Fridman. I think it was an episode with Balaji Srinivasan, where Balaji, who's an investor-type guy, thinker-type guy-- this is like an eight-hour episode. He says something at the beginning that I'd love your thoughts on. He said, look, we can train a rat to lever press every other time or to expect reward on every even number press or every odd number press or even every fifth number press. But a human and a rat can't do that for like prime number presses. You can't actually train that. And then you think about the reward systems and the way that we follow life, from when we get up until we go to sleep, and what he said is the fact that we can't do that means that we may not actually be in touch with the best schedules of doing things. Like every time I'm thirsty, I take a sip. I assume that's the right way to do it, but it might not be optimal, for whatever purpose. When I was reading your book, I was thinking about there's a set of things to follow, things to pay attention to-- you talk about this-- things to access, that none of the creative process comes from just within us. It can, but it's always being fed by things outside of it. And so what I started to do is, the second time I read through the book, was think about it through the lens of what Balaji was saying was that there may not even be a language for this thing that we call accessing creativity. There's a process, but that language in the form of words is a little bit like trying to use even numbers to try and access prime numbers. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like the math becomes so convoluted that we end up in a conversation like this, where I'm confident we can get to the kernels of it. Because what's remarkable about the book is that you do. You show and inform the process. But there may not be a English or any other language for saying, do this, then this, then this, then this, and you'll have something of creative value. Does that capture it? RICK RUBIN: Yes. I think language is insufficient to drill down on creativity. It's closer to magic than it is science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So when kids come into the world, do you think that they have better access to this creative process than we do as adults? Because we start to impart rule plays and books. Like will it get likes? Will people like it? But also all the things that are available to us that we're not paying attention to, like the texture of this table, we're discarding things, systematically. We get, quote, unquote, set in our ways. Do you think kids are, just by definition and by design, more creative than adults? RICK RUBIN: Yes. Kids, they're open, and they have no baggage. They don't have any belief system. They don't know how things are supposed to work. They just see what is, and if we pay attention to what is, we learn much more than if we-- Most of us select from an endless number of data points available to us to, well, as a species, to make sure that we don't die and to procreate and to feed ourselves are probably the primary functions first. And then we learn things about what's right and what's wrong, and we learn things about how to do certain things. Or we're inspired by someone who makes something we love, and we want to do it the way they do it. And all of those things undermine the purity of the creative process. They can be tools to build your skill set to be able to do it yourself. Like if you're a singer, you might imitate a singer you really like for a while to get good at it and then eventually come to find your own voice. It doesn't always start with your own voice. But if you're three years old or five years old, and you try singing, you're not singing like anyone else. You're singing with your own voice. And when you make something, you're making it based on not knowing. And I think I had the advantage, early in my career, of starting making music without any experience, which was helpful, because I didn't know what rules I was breaking. And so it wasn't intentional breaking of rules. I just did what seemed right to me, but I didn't realize that I was doing things that other people wouldn't do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There is this idea that there are no new ideas. I disagree, because every once in a while, I'll see or hear something that at least seems different enough. RICK RUBIN: I think it's a combination of-- a new combination of existing ideas presented in a new way. I think that's how it works. I don't know. But I will say, it does seem like the things that are most interesting to me have a series of familiar elements joined together in a way that it's creating something that I've never seen before. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned that when you are close to or you see hints of creativity that is of real value that it's a feeling, and I also believe that the body is a great source of information. Which once people will realize that the brain, of course, is in the skull, but the nervous system extends everywhere in the body, the whole mind-body thing just falls away. Philosophers have argued about this forever, but it's a silly argument. It's also true that, God forbid, I were to amputate all my limbs, have them amputated, I'd fundamentally still be me. Right? The same is not true if we took out a big enough chunk of my brain, and I still survived. I would be a fundamentally different human being. I'd still have the same name and identity and social security number, but I would behave very differently. Who knows, maybe better? The signals from the body we know, or at least we assume, are pretty generic. Like I can think of 50 different ways or 100 ways that we could talk about creativity today. And we could define it and redefine it and carve it up and serve it up like sushi in a bunch of different ways. But the body sends signals that most of us are-- we have a course understanding of. It's like, oh, my stomach hurts, or my stomach feels good, or I'm not sensing my stomach. Or oh, that feels good. It feels warm. It feels cold. Like most of us aren't trained in understanding how to interpret those signals. So it's almost like you have a few vowels, a few syllables, and there isn't a lot more. Whereas, we talk about our thoughts and our experiences, depending on how hyper verbal somebody is and how much emphasis they put on different sounds, it's near infinite. Not infinite, but near infinite. So for you personally, when you know that you're on the end of a thread of creativity-- maybe you're listening to an artist, or you're hearing something. And you're like there and the your antennae start to deflect in a certain way. Right? Do you feel that in your body as a recognizable sensation, or is it a thought and a sensation? RICK RUBIN: It's a feeling in my body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it localized? RICK RUBIN: No. It's a feeling of-- I would say it's like a surge of energy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you remember the first time you experienced that? RICK RUBIN: Probably hearing the Beatles, when I was three or four years old. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Three or four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there something wrong with me that the Beatles have never done it for me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe you just weren't exposed at the right time in the right way. There's no right or wrong way, and everyone-- I can love the Beatles, and you can not, and we're both right. There's not-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm glad we can still be friends. I was a little concerned. I was a little scared to ask you that question. I know my taste in music is a little bit obscure and fragmentary, but good. I've always felt like, gosh, there must be something wrong with me. I like their songs, but they don't-- there's no juice for me there. RICK RUBIN: I think maybe we'll watch-- there was an eight-part series called The Beatles Anthology, which is out of print. But I can try to find it somewhere, and we can watch that together, and maybe that'll make the case for the Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing against them, it's just I'm always bothering you for a story, but like Ramones. I saw that, and I was like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone had to change their last name to Ramone, a lot of them hated each other. There's so much drama in there, and three chords and just-- but to me, it just was like, wow, like kids from New York, that energy. So I think different things for different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that brings me to a question of when something feels creatively right, and you're sensing it, and you're there, let's say in the studio or maybe even you're listening to something that somebody sent you, how do you translate that, given the absence of language? How do you translate that into a conversation with the artist? And again, this could be about writing or comedy or science or podcasting, for that matter. How do you say that, keep going that way, when they might not even recognize that they did it? And I'm guessing a lot of times, they don't. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. Sometimes, they don't. It depends. When we're in the-- I'll try to be in a setting where, as we're talking about it, we can engage with it in that moment. So it's not much good. Let's say I was producing your new record, and you played me something, and I had some thoughts about it. It wouldn't be so helpful for me to tell you what those were. It'd be better for us to wait till we were in a place where we could try things and see where it goes. So the first thing is I wouldn't rely on language to do it. It would be more of making a suggestion of something that's actionable. We try it, and then we have more data. And either we're moving in a good direction, or we're moving away from-- we're moving towards it or away from it, and we never know. And so it's always an experiment. And maybe a simple way to talk about it would be like, if I gave you two dishes of food and asked you to taste them and tell me which one you like better. Usually, it's pretty straightforward, when you have two choices, which you like better, and I think most creativity can be boiled down to that. That's very different than I wonder how this is going to perform on certain social media platforms? That's different than what is it-- when I'm tasting these two things, which is the one I want to finish eating? And if I were to say, I like this one better, but it needs a little salt, and then put a little salt on it. It's like, maybe I put too much salt, and you know when you taste it. It's like it's that simple. Being in tune enough with ourselves to really know how we feel in the face of knowing that other people might feel very differently, which is part of the challenge. It's like, if everyone tells you A, A, A, A, A, A, and you listen, and you're like that's B, as an artist, it's important to be able to say, to me, it's B. And it's a disconnect, because so much of, when we go to school, it's to get us to follow the rules. And in art, it's different, because the rules are there as a scaffolding to be chipped away, as need be. Sometimes, they're helpful. Sometimes, they're not, and sometimes, we'll even impose our own rules to give something its shape. So we can decide to make a-- we're going to make a painting, but we're only going to use green and red are the only colors we're allowed to use. We decide that in advance, and then how do we solve the problem knowing all we have is green and red? It can-- because otherwise, if there's an infinite number of choices, anything can be anything. It's like, sometimes more choices is not better. So limiting your palate to something manageable forces you to solve problems in a different way. Now, in our digital age music-wise, you can make anything digitally. There's no-- there was a time when, if you didn't have a guitar in the studio, you couldn't record guitar. Or if you couldn't hire an orchestra, there couldn't be orchestra on your recording. Now, you can just call any of those things up. So there's infinite choices, and infinite choices don't necessarily lead to better compositions or better final works. Understanding how you feel in the face of other voices, without second guessing yourself, is probably the single most important thing to practice as an artist. Or a skill set to develop as an artist is to I know how you feel, and own your feelings. And the key to that is not I know, so I know what's right for you. It doesn't work that way. It's just I know for me, and the reason I chose to be an artist is to demonstrate this is how I see it. If I'm undermining my taste for some commercial idea, it defeats the whole purpose of doing this. That's not what this process is about. This process is I'm doing me, and I'm showing you who I am. And you can like it or not, but either way, this is still how I see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that, because in science, having trained graduate students, having been a graduate student, I was very blessed to have mentors, one of who is a real iconoclast. He's dead now. Actually, all my advisors are dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. The joke is you don't want me to work for you. So they all had a morbid sense of humor, so they're laughing about this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: I thought you were going to say they all ate the poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but the last one said to me, you're the common denominator, Andrew. And I thought, oh my goodness, and he said, kind of just kidding, but not really. So it's a little bit eerie. But in any case, he always said-- his name was Ben-- he always said, the one thing I can't teach is taste, and the one predictor I have of the people who will never develop it are the ones who are perfectionists. Because they're filtering their-- perfectionists that filter their perfection through the feedback of others. He was always looking for the person that was putting up a little bit of a middle finger to feedback. Not so much that they would get things wrong, because it can be badly wrong in science. You can be wrong for the right reasons, but you can also be wrong for the wrong reasons. But people that just had almost a compulsion to do it their way or to believe in what they were doing. And I'm hearing some of that, or I'm hearing that in what you're describing. I also think that there's something about the human empathic process or the emotional process, where when we see somebody doing something and they seem to really not be paying attention to what anyone else is doing-- I guess the crazy person on the street is one version of it, where we go they're just in their experience, and it's just crazy. But when somebody seems to be enjoying themselves or the emotion seems to be real, I think there are a good fraction of people who feel a gravitational pull, and they go, yeah, that. And the best example I have of this is I remember growing up in the skateboard thing we were the first-- we were the first to start doing the baggy, sagging clothes thing, and we got teased endlessly one year in school. Then, there was a bunch of hip hop that came out, and guys were wearing sagging their jeans or their shorts. Next year, we come back, and the very same people who were making fun of us we're all doing it, and that's when it clicked for me. I was like, most people don't actually know what they like. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They like what they like because of the certainty of the people that they like. And so the question then is, in this landscape of creative stuff, what's real? What's not real? It's almost like whoever can create the most convincing story at least captures a good number of-- a good fraction of audiences, but that's not what the creative artist needs to do. They need to actually depart from that. Do I have that right? RICK RUBIN: Well they're just two different things. Like coming up with a story with the purpose of pleasing someone else is a skill set, but it's more of a commercial endeavor than an artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was thinking, in your book, you describe, again, when you're thinking about the creative process as a cloud, for me, again, it serves as such a powerful anchor. And then I think about the biology, the neurobiology, of like strategy formation or strategy implementation and then almost by sheer luck, or miraculously, I turn a few pages later into the book, and there's a description of how animals that are trying to accomplish something-- eat, mate, find water, accomplish the requirements of living-- it requires a narrow visual focus. This is something my lab is obsessed with, and I've been obsessed with. And in that more narrow visual focus, we know that the playbook becomes more narrow. The rule set is more narrow. Now, at some point, in order to come up with a new creative idea, that means that broadening vision is essential, in some way, or broadening thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, it could either be a broadening or a narrowing, but it's changing the aperture from the standard. The reason we do this is to present something new that maybe you already knew but didn't know you knew it. And for that to be the case, you have to be looking at it. It's not unlike what a comedian does. Comedian makes you laugh. Usually, what they're saying, it's outrageous, but you know that it's right. Just no one says it that way, or no one has said it that way before. But it's always the truth in it that makes it funny. It's like that. It's the same idea as recognizing something that seems really obvious, once you see it, but it seems like nobody else sees it, or no one else points it out. And I feel like science is like that too, because how much of science, once the light flashes over your head, it's like I got it, it just seems like, well, we knew that forever. No one knew it, but do you know what I'm saying? It's like it's so obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: It's so obvious. And I think another superpower of artists is this accepting we don't know anything. When we think we know things, that also limits our world. We think we know it's only like this. This is all that's possible, where nice in this little box. But in reality, who's to say that's the case? Who's to say any of the-- we could take all of what we believe in science now and decide to throw all of that away and start from scratch. And we'd probably create a whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens every single day. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take Athletic Greens, is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs. So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not, I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs for vitamins, minerals, probiotics, adaptogens to combat stress, and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion. I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and for the month of January, they have a special offer, where they'll give you 10 free travel packs, plus a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. Vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function, metabolic function, hormone health, but also calcium regulation and heart health. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim their special offer, in the month of January, of 10 free travel packs, plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2. In an offline conversation one time, you asked a good friend of mine, who's been a guest on this podcast, Eddie Chang, who's chair of neurosurgery, and I would place him in the top 1% of neuroscientists. He's pulling speech out of people who are completely paralyzed with locked-in syndrome, et cetera. And you asked him, what percentage of what's contained in medical textbooks and training-- RICK RUBIN: Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. If you went to medical school today, and you learned what was in the textbook, what percentage of that information is accurate, and what percentage is not? And he said, maybe half. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right, and you asked, and what is the consequence of that? And he said, incalculable, and I completely agree. And I asked him a second time, and he still came up with the same answer. So that's a good sign. Reliability from experiment to the next is good. Yeah. I think that there is this idea that we really know things. In science, we've observed amazing discoveries from chance. We've observed amazing discoveries from incredible bouts of hard work. In both cases, people were spending a lot of time in the lab. Like no one walked into the lab, saw something one day, and had a Nobel Prize winning discovery or fundamental discovery. They were all hanging out in lab a lot. Just some of them came up with something that they didn't expect. Others were drilling toward an answer. RICK RUBIN: And in all those cases, when the breakthroughs happen-- I'm guessing. I don't know this-- that considering we assume this information, then this discovery is true, based on everything that came before it. But if everything that came before it is wrong, then the discoveries are probably built on a-- do you know what I'm saying? It's like the context, everything that happens takes into account that the context that it's sitting in it fits in that context. Maybe that context isn't right. Who knows? We don't know. So I'm saying, we're too close to most things in thinking, when we think we things, where there are a lot of assumptions that go into it. And that any new discoveries are essentially built on top of these beliefs, but they're beliefs. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I remember-- of course, I listened to the Beastie Boys growing up. Who didn't? I was a child of the 90s, and they were in the-- Sabotage was an outgrowth of a skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones and like the girl movies. And those worlds, the Beastie Boys and skateboarding were really closely interwoven for a while. Some people know that. Some people don't. And Spike formed the bridge, and then Spike went off and started making more bigger movies that more people watch. But let's just use them as an example. I heard you say once before that you guys were joking around, like Beastie Boys, like these guys doing hip hop, but it was kind of like the hardcore scene, in New York, punk rock scene, and it was a joke. There were a lot of inside jokes. When you were working together, was there the thought that people might love it, might hate it, or you just weren't paying attention at all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention at all. Never considered it. There were no-- at that point in time, when we were making Licensed to Ill, hip hop music was a tiny underground thing. And no one making hip hop at that time thought it would ever mean anything. It was not a realistic thought. So we were making it really for our crazy friends, and that's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So do you think, nowadays, the fact that one can create something and, quote, unquote, release it quickly. I can put something out onto Twitter or Instagram now. We could do it in 10 seconds from now, and I will get immediate feedback, which is external feedback, of course, but then I can iterate on the basis of that feedback. Do you think that's problematic for the larger opportunity for creativity? In other words, if we were to go back 20 years or even 15 years, when the opportunity to create was certainly still there, but you really didn't know how it was going to land until you, quote, unquote, released it. It seems to me there was more opportunity to stay in that magical rainforest that is the creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: I don't think it's wrong or right. It's just more information that you can use or not use and use it in a useful way. And you can make something and put it out, and people could not like it. And you're like, oh, they still don't get it. I'm going to I got to go harder. Like I got to go harder in that direction not-- do you know what I'm saying? It's like not to react away from information. It can be helpful. It can be helpful when-- there could be different stories that happen at the same time. Where you're making something, and you have an idea of what it is. And then other people engage with it, and they have a different idea of what it is. And they like it for a different reason than you did or dislike it for a reason different than the reason you like it. We can't control any of those things. The only part of it that we can control is how we relate to the thing that we make. And any external information that undermines the clarity of that connection is probably bad for the art is my guess. And again, I'm only saying this from my experience. I try to make things-- all I've ever tried to make was something I like or something that I felt like was missing as a fan that I wanted, and nobody was making it. So I'll make it, but it wasn't-- it was always in the service of I love this thing. I want something like this. No one else is making one. I have to make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. It's beautiful, because the word that keeps coming to mind is it's almost like a compulsion. Like there are other options of ways to be and to behave and to function and work in life. But if something is a compulsion, it yanks us away from those other opportunities, just enough that we have to get back to it. You've talked before about, and you talk in the book, this notion of the source. And to me, again, I can't help but put my neuroscientist lens on this. I think of the source as not one brain area but some function within the brain, where we are in touch with our bodily signals. Like what feels right, what doesn't? Or like tasting the two foods, I love that example. And that it's a playbook that is far more vast than the short term adaptive playbook, like this how I'm going to get from point A to point B. And yet, when I listen to an album or a song, I have to assume that there, at some point, it becomes not strategy development or creativity but strategy implementation. Like there needs to be the songs are going to come in this order-- and I don't know much about music. My musician friends are always laughing. RICK RUBIN: It's not so much about music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, but the ordering of the sequence of the melodies, et cetera. So at what point does one decide, OK, like now's the time to get into that more narrow focus of effort? Like we've got it. Let's run with this. Because there is a component of the creative process that involves packaging and finishing. And is that part less satisfying to you, or is it just all part of the same larger arc? RICK RUBIN: It's all part of the same. It's nice. There's a good feeling. There's usually a good feeling when something is done. On the one hand, it's a commitment, because up until the time that you say it's done, you can keep experimenting and changing it. If you think, well, maybe tomorrow I can make it better, then it's not finished. And you keep thinking that for a long time, you can do that forever and never put out anything. So getting to the point where you're ready to sign off is a good feeling, and it allows you-- one of the things I talk about in the book is, because it is a difficult thing to do, because it's fun to play, and it's fun to maybe it's not the best it could be yet. To use whatever the next project is going to be as motivation to finish the one you're working on now. Like I'm working on this. I'm spending all of my time on this thing. It's really good. I believe it can be better, but there's this other thing that I really want to make. And if I keep tinkering with this one, I'll never get to make the other one. So using other projects as an impetus to finish something and release it into the world is a good one. And you said your description of source is something within us. I don't know if I would say that was accurate. It's definitely in us too, but it's not only in us. And it's I think of source as the organizing principle of everything, and it's how everything exists. How the trees grow, and why there are mountains. And anything that we can see in the outside world, and every discovery and every piece of art and every new design and every machine are all outgrowths of this source energy. Our part of it is the antenna that connects to it, and maybe where the vehicle for source to allow things to happen in the world. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And thank you for that, because I did indeed misspeak. Because I recall very distinctly in the book, you described how the physical world is constrained by the laws of physics and certain things. The imagination is unconstrained. And I think I have this right, that you said the work set somewhere between those, it's neither of one nor the other. That ultimately what feeds into all of that are imagination and the way, indeed, that our brain is a physical entity. The nature in the outside world provides at least what appears to be near infinite if not infinite options. And I love the example of the color palette. That if we restrict me to whatever sorts of paints or medium I have, then it's restricted. But in nature, there's an infinite number of shades and tones and combinations. RICK RUBIN: And even on one, if you pick up a rock and look at the color of the rock and tried to find a paint to match that rock, it would never match. There's too much. There are too many variations in nature within a single color rock for us to get close. There's too much information. We scratch the surface. We're only scratching the surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we love when we are able to peer in at different scales, spatial scales, time scales too, but spatial scales, the delight that comes from that that these nature pictures-- seemed like there were more of these in the '80s, like where you'd see a drop of oil shot at very high resolution. There's beauty in a drop of oil. And then you'd see the Earth and the galaxy, there's beauty in that too, these extremes. And of course, our daily perception is mostly through the filter of these kinds of interactions, walls, and sometimes outdoors. There's a brilliant neuroscientist, and not surprisingly, he has a Nobel. His name is Richard Axel. He's at Columbia University. He's outrageous personality. Chews Nicorette nonstop. You guys would get along great, not because of the Nicorette, but because his perspective on things is very abstract for a guy who's solved-- he won the Nobel for solving a great problem within how we smell, perception of odors and tastes. And he says that everything that the brain does is an abstraction. Like I could take a photograph of your face and show it to you, and you'd say, yeah, that's me. Or let's say for the moment, I call myself an abstract artist. Let's just play a game, because I've never been accused of being an artist. And I do three dots and a squiggly line, and I say that's you. And you say, well, that doesn't look like me, and I say, but that's my abstraction of you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, the brain essentially does that, because or something in between that. Because there's no actual photograph of you in my brain. It's just a bunch of neurons playing what we call an ensemble, like a different keys on a piano. And we go, Rick, I recognize you, Rick Rubin. And so everything is an abstraction, and it's only once we start tinkering with the parts-- and this is the essence of science, to remove and add and manipulate. And the best example I can come up with would be Rothko. And I only we come up with this example because I started off in vision science and maybe this will make the most sense to everyone, except the folks who've been blind since birth, and they can swap something in here. That if I show you a Rothko, and I don't tell you it's a Rothko, you may or may not actually think it's that impressive. It depends on your taste in art. But what Rothko did, which was amazing, even if you don't like Rothkos-- and I happened to-- is that he removed all the white and high contrast-y stuff. And when you do that you alter color space, and so the colors look very different. Some people saw that dress a few years ago, is it orange, or is a gold or whatever? That was a little bit of the same phenomenon. I doubt-- in fact, I'd be willing to bet my left arm that Rothko knew nothing about the neuroscience of color perception. But somehow got to this place where, if there was no canvas showing and no high contrast and the paintings were large enough and on the appropriate wall, you saw them a certain way that tapped into something fundamental. And this is where I think art and science really converge, is that, every once in a while, we see something that feels amazing to enough people-- and not just like the baggy pants phenomenon, not just because other people think it's cool. But there's something there, and again this defies language. And I have to imagine that in your years of life and music and other creative endeavors, that every once in a while, have you ever encountered something where something fundamental keeps showing up in different form? Or there's something like almost like a rule or a principle, does that ever come about? Because in science, we think of this as like this is reveals something about our limitation to abstract the world. I hope I made that clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly but I have a thought. You talked earlier about the drop of oil, the photograph of the drop of oil and the photograph-- or we could use, on the other side, like Hubble telescope images of these vast things in high definition. What we see every day is as impressive as those things, but where numb to them, because we see them all the time. And if we were to look at drops of oil every day in a microscope, a month from now, we would not find wonder in that image. So sometimes, it's the novelty of not seeing it from that perspective before that's really thrilling. And I could imagine, and this probably relates to the Rothko idea, that you could see something from a particular angle and have this magical experience. And then walk three feet to the side and see it from a different way, and it just evaporates. It only works-- it only triggers this thing in us when we look at it just the right way. There was an experiment I just heard about, heard about the other day, that sounds fascinating, that a painting teacher recommended. Where instead of painting-- having a model in the room and painting the model, that you have the model in the next room. And you go into the next room without your equipment. You don't have your equipment, and you can study the model for as long as you want. And then you go into a different room, where you can't see the model, and paint the model, instead of-- and it changes your relationship. We're not just painting the lines. We're painting what is interesting enough about what I saw-- what are the data points that stuck in my mind? And when I string those together, what do I get? And what do I-- how do I form it to get as close to whatever the experience of that person was, which the closest of getting to the experience of that person in the painting might not look like a photograph. It might look more different then more the same to really see what you see. If we think about the Picasso paintings that were inspired by African art, where the eyes are on different levels, they may give us more information than a photograph would give us. I'm thinking about when you were describing the sensation of when something takes your breath away, and we all have that when we see a dramatic sunset. Anyone you know, when there's a really dramatic sunset, or if there's a whale, and if anyone's on the beach, and there's a whale, everybody's really interested that there's a whale. Do you know what I'm saying? These feelings of wonder, we get to experience them, depending on where we are. Or a dragonfly or a bird flies into your space, these things happen. And when they happen, it's like we're confronted with the mystery of the world, when we change the perspective. Normally, we don't think of whales in our backyard or birds in our house, flying freely, but they do happen. these things do happen, and they like break us out of our trance when these things happen. It's like, oh, yeah, there are birds like this everywhere. I'm just not paying attention. This guy is coming in to tap me on the shoulder. It's like remember me? Here I am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I would say that the whale example and what you're describing is it's revealing to us how-- in a delightful way-- how deficient our perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a little bit like the Rothko is revealing how-- I've never thought about it this way until this moment-- is revealing to us how color normally looks is actually, first of all, not the only way it looks. Those colors we think are one way, but all of color-- this gets into the biology of color vision-- is all about contrast. What something is next to dictates what it looks like, and that's the origin of that dress meme or whatever you call it. I still can't figure out exactly what a meme is. Someone will eventually tell me. In the same way, when you see a whale, and it's delightful, I think it's revealing to us the extent to which those whales are-- the ocean is vast. There's a whole universe there, and we are blind to it all the time. And I think the misperception-- or the misconception, excuse me, is that we're delighted because we see the whale. We might be just as delighted because we're getting hit with the contrast of how little we recognize all the time, and in that way, it reminds me a little bit about comedy. And I've been watching more comedy lately, and sometimes, it's the shock. Sometimes, it's the absolute truth that's revealed, and then other times, what I've noticed-- and I saw Rogen do comedy at the Vulcan Club, in Austin, which he does every once in a while. And it was small club, and he was leading out this story during his routine or bit, I think. Right? This bit, and everyone knew where it was going. We all knew, and then when he finally told us, it was exactly where we thought it was going, and it was hilarious. RICK RUBIN: And it felt good. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it felt amazing, and I thought in that moment, I was like, wait a second, how did he pull that off? That was masterful, because normally, it's this thing like you create one story. There's like a scripting out, almost like a courtroom lawyer. And then they kind of pull the curtain, and it's something different. And if you look at the science, the neuroscience, and brain imaging of laughter and humor, which I've looked into, to be honest, and no disrespect to the people in that field, it's pretty lame. It's lame, because it's always the jarring nature of a surprise. But what he led us to was something that, oh, no, he's actually going there. Oh, wait, he's really going there, and it was this anticipation with a beautiful delivery at the end. And so I'm convinced that, based on what we're talking about here, that there's something about when we see something, we think it's about that, but that the delight that we feel could be about the other experiences that now become, in a subconscious way, like ha. It's almost like laughing at this perceptual deficit that we have. It's almost like laughing at how little we actually know, which is what you've said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. It could be that. It also could be the sense of community of when you think it's going to go a particular way, and it goes that way. It's like reinforcement of you. It's like, yeah, he's saying it, but in a way, we're saying it together. I'm listening, he's saying it, but we're in this together, and that's a good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have to think about that for a second. I was trying to think about why certain music still can evoke such powerful emotions in me. And there does seem to be something special about the music we listen to when we are teenagers. From about 14 until about 25, it seems to get routed into our nervous system in some way. Maybe because that phase of our life is really one of identity crisis. You don't find too many 40-year-olds, some, who are wondering like who they are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, but almost every young teenager or pre-teen and is like who am I? You're defining personality. So I always likened it to that. But leaving out the critical period biology stuff, what do you think it is about the music that we hear at that time? Are that much more emotionally tuned? Have we not shut down our sensors quite as much? Because the songs and the artists don't matter, because they're very individual to me. For other people, it will be the Beatles or something. Now, I just really wish the Beatles did it for me too. But do you think that's important? Because I could see how it's really terrific. I could also see how it sets up one of these what I'll just use nerdy language and call like a semi-deprived filter. Because if I'm only looking for the way that a Stiff Little Fingers track made me feel the first time I listened to it, when I was 15, the feeling is worthwhile. But if I'm looking for that, I'm missing all the other stuff. I'm missing the Beatles. I'm missing Fleetwood Mac, which never did it for me either. I'm like, I'm missing all this stuff that people I love and respect really love. So I've never worried about it, because there's an infinite treasure trove of other things that I do love. But I do sometimes wonder whether or not my life experience is diminished, because I'm not allowing range. And you've, obviously, worked in a huge number of different genres of music. Punk is one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? And in some sense, as I list these off, just think about how much in high school, maybe nowadays less so, but even in college and as an adult, societally, were asked to constrain ourselves to one of these groups. I didn't know it was OK to love Bob Dylan and love punk rock as much as I do, until I heard Tim Armstrong said he loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I was like-- and recently, he told me he loves the Grateful Dead, and I was like, whoa. But I remember when you had to pick. RICK RUBIN: Both the Ramones and the Clash love the Beatles, so we can-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. I got work to do. RICK RUBIN: We'll do it together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN: I have a feeling part of it is, the reason it gets in at that age, is it's a time when we're defining who we are, and the music is part of the definition of how we see ourselves. Like the music that we hear before that might be the music that's on the radio or our parents' music or our older brother or sister's music. And then when you're 14 or 15, and you start choosing what you're listening to, it's like, now it's finally mine. And my parents might not like it, and my older brothers and sisters may or may not like it, but this one is mine. And it always has that impression in us that this is ours. My that's my thought of why it continues to last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How do you wipe the slate clean then? So for instance, if you're going to go in and work with somebody new-- and again, as people are hearing this, I hope that they're transplanting this to whatever it is that they do. Because in the realm of science and podcasting and communication, it's not music, but there's a contour and a way. Hopefully, this podcast will look nothing like it does in five years. That's my hope, is it will still have the core features of the beauty and utility of biology coming through, but I hope it doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK RUBIN: And I think it'll evolve as you evolve. It's just, the truer it is to what interests you, and if you're not interested in biology in the same way in five years, I would hope it's not the same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll be doing psychoanalysis in real time here. In therapy, we'll all be lying down on couches. RICK RUBIN: Whatever it is. Whatever it is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. We probably won't be on psychedelics, but we might be levitating. You never know. I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done, for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors-- lipids and hormones and so forth-- but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors-- hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health-- to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So how do you-- let's talk a little bit, if you would, because I know I'm very interested in your process. I'll spare you the daily routine question. It's very cliche. But you and I are both lovers of sunlight, of horizons, and not as a trivial source, as an amazing gift of energy. Right? And there aren't words for it really. Aside from your daily routines, when it comes to somebody you're going from project to project, and you know you're going to be doing work with somebody, could be your own work. And we'll talk about the writing of this book and its structure which is very unique. I've never encountered a book with this kind of structure before, and it's the most facile read ever, and yet every single page, I underlined, took notes, starred. And like, as you notice, it's very worn, very, very worn already and only more so over time. Do you have a process for removing the functions of the day and what you were doing last week and what's going on in order to get more access to this-- I'm going to think of it now more as a receiver inside of you. Right? Almost like tuning a radio, [IMITATING STATIC] and then it comes in. Like the beginning of like a Strummer Clash thing. Right? He love the radio. Joe loved the radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] and then it comes in clear, and there it is. How do you clear the static? What are some of the operational steps that you think might be more generalizable, regardless of where somebody in Africa is listening to this. RICK RUBIN: I would say, when I engage in a particular project, whatever it is, I dedicate all of myself for that period of time, whatever it is. Whether it be 20 minutes or whether it be five hours, whatever it is, total focus, and no outside distraction whatsoever. And when I leave that process, I do my best not to think about it, when I'm away from it. I don't bring any materials with me. I don't leave the studio with works in progress and spend time listening to them during the day or looking for ideas. I stay as far away from it, when I'm not directly engaging in it, as possible. And in the best of situations, I have something else to totally engage myself in in between. So instead of working on project A for five hours, and then leaving and doing nothing, I'm hoping to engage in a Project B or B, C, and D with all of myself before going back to project A again, which might be the next day, let's say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this relates to an amazing chapter and series of writings in your book, that I'm not going to describe, because I want people to find it for themselves, about disengaging, about disengaging from the process. One question I had as I read that chapter, and as you're saying this now, is even though you're disengaged, do you believe that your subconscious is working it through? RICK RUBIN: I believe so. I believe so, and I think in general, to stew over a problem is not the way to solve a problem. I think to hold the problems lightly-- and when I say a problem, when we're starting a project, there's usually this feeling of-- there's a question mark, at the beginning of every project. I'm always anxious when I start a new project, because I have no idea what's going to happen. I never know. I never-- I may have, in some cases, a potential backup plan, if nothing works, but I really try not even to have that. I prefer not to have that. I prefer to go in maybe to calm myself down enough to be able to show up, there'll be an idea of, if nothing works, maybe we could try something like this. But that would only be for my own anxiety. It wouldn't be for actual practical use. But there's always a sense of anxiety, because I know, whatever's going to happen is completely out of my control. Something either interesting or not will appear, and then we're going to follow that wherever it goes. And until something appears for us to follow, I have a lot of anxiety, even though it has never not come. It has come every time, but there's something about it-- because I also feel like there might be expectation on me that I'm going to make it happen, and I know that's not happening. That's not how it works. I show up ready for it to happen and am open to whatever we have to do to find that first thread. And once we find the thread, then it's like, OK, we have a-- and that thread may lead us to anything. It could lead us in a million different directions. But something about having that glimmer, that we're not looking at a blank page. We're looking at, OK, we have the beginnings of, I would say, a map. But it's a map that we don't know where it takes us, and it's just the beginning. It's just like, you are here. If you have a map, and it says you are here, even if you can't see the directions, knowing where we are feels OK. And once we get-- and usually, again, usually in the first day, first couple of days, it happens. But up until then, it's really an anxiety-producing situation, and then I can't remember the original question. So that was the beginning of something completely different. But do you remember what you asked? I don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Well, we were talking about disengaging, and is your subconscious into it? And then we're talking about, I love this. So like what is your process of wading into this thing? And you're revealing that now. I think of anxiety as readiness. I think about the characteristic features of anxiety, it tends to be a bit of a constriction of the visual field into more of a narrow vision. But that's appropriate, because you want to shed what's going on elsewhere. And then even when people talk about the shakes or this like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety was designed to mobilize us and not always to run away. Rarely do I talk about the work in my own laboratory, but one of the things that-- frankly, I didn't discover but it was done in my laboratory but is brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, who's now at Caltech, was that we can often observe animals or humans in very high states of anxiety, as they move forward toward a goal. And we always think of moving forward as like this calm thing, these heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like I'm not getting off the back. I'm not leaving the-- giving up my seat on the bus or Muhammad Ali. I bet you they were experiencing tremendous anxiety, but it was in the forward tilt. And so I think anxiety is at least comfortable when we are forcing ourselves to stand still. So it's a activating energy, and that brings up a word that I have written in my notebook as an extraction of a lot of themes from within the book that you and I have talked about before, which is-- and here I'm going to sound very West Coast woo. But I mean it as seriously as it can be stated, that I feel like everything is energetic. We can do things from a place of anger. We can do things from a place of joy. We can do things from a place of delight. I like to think maturing into the idea that joy and delight and love is the ultimate reservoir of energy. But a lot of the music that I like from when I was younger was because of the anger that was thread into it or the sadness. RICK RUBIN: If you think of your relationship to that music, it's a relationship of love. You didn't listen to that to get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: You listened to it because you loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I felt loved by it, because it matched where I was at the time. RICK RUBIN: It was true to who you were and where you were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I know that collaboration, there's a wonderful chapter on collaboration, but it's collaboration, as you mentioned before, with the universe, not with others. But in terms of the, especially the kind of work that you've done and do, when it comes to working with artists, I do wonder-- and here I'm not looking for any gossip or stories. I've never been interested in gossip. I love stories, but I'm not interested in gossip. But once you see that thread dangling there, and you're going to go after this. Or you grab on to it, and you're like, OK, now you have a little bit of a map and an orientation within that map. I often wonder, scientists are complicated people. People think they're very boring, but they're actually very complicated. Because they're often living in one limited rule set of the prefrontal cortex. That's how you get good at getting degrees is by understanding the rules of academia and playing by those rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker with the rules. You get your Richard Axels who are very playful in how they go about it, but they are systematic. He's known for rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? When I think of creative artists and musical artists, I think of a bit more zany or loose. Or you watch the documentary about the Ramones, and you're like, wow, there's all this chaos. How-- because so many of the brilliant artists, musical artists that are out there, seem to have some chaos inside them, or their lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. And science too, by the way, there are substance abuse issues and personal life issues. How-- since you don't have 100% control, they need to play the instruments, sing, et cetera. How do you work with people who have it in them but are getting in their own way? Right? And do you think that the internal chaos that a lot of artists seem to have, do you think that sometimes is actually an essential piece of the creativity picture, that you can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. I don't think it's an essential piece in general, but certain artists, that's how they do it. I would say, I rarely get to see the chaotic part of artists. For whatever reason, they rarely show it to me, and most of them, like most comedians I know, are much more serious about what they're doing than what it looks like from if you see them on stage. There's much more to it, and there's much more focus on craft going on and digging deep than would necessarily be obvious seeing them jump around on stage. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm a fan of boxing, track and field and boxing, the sports nobody really cares about, now that UFC is so popular. And track and field is-- it's a little bit like wrestling. When you go, the people that are there are there because they really love it. We'll talk about wrestling in a little bit, professional wrestling. But Floyd Mayweather is obviously a colorful character and one of the best records in boxing of all time. And a few years back, I got into watching his stuff, and what one sees is the cars and the money. They literally call themselves the money team, and the spending, and there's all the outrageous stuff. But I know someone who was in camp with him who actually was a sparring partner for him, and the lore has it-- they have very closed door sparring or clean ups. But the lore is that he would do-- because nowadays, it's 12, three-minute rounds with a minute in between, used to be 15. But now, neuroscientists stepped in, and it turns out a lot of the deaths were occurring when it was more than 12 rounds. For whatever reason, cut off at 12 really seemed to truncate the deaths. There are other things too. If the dad is apparently a cornerman-- we have someone else here at the podcast who knows more about this than me. RICK RUBIN: That's fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. The kid not wanting to disappoint the parent correlated with death. I'll get some of this wrong, and they can come after me. But in any case, this guy who was in Floyd's camp said that he would do 30 to 60 minutes of sparring, bringing in fresh sparring partners with no rest. That he would run three or four times per 24 hour cycle, despite all the critical need for sleep. That his training was unbelievably intense, to the point where he would just chew out, chew up, and destroy all training partners. And yet the perception that we see is it's playful for him. So it sounds very similar. Like what we see is often not what goes into it, that people are intensely rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, and I think, in a way, from a psychological perspective, if you knew you were fighting someone who wasn't taking it seriously, that would give you some confidence, and that would not be a good thing, if the person was actually working really hard, outworking you. Do you know what I'm saying? Like from a psychological perspective, that makes sense to me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what I keep coming back to is that I'm imagining in my mind you have to ends of the continuum. One that is about fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, and then the other side is the cloud. It's very nebulous. Right? And there's this word that I learned from a colleague of mine, when I was down at the Salk Institute, when my lab was there, because he studies this. There's this phenomenon that I don't want to mispronounce, because then it sounds like something else. But the correct pronunciation is pareidolia, and pareidolia is our tendency to look at an amorphous shape, like a cloud or a tree, and think that it looks like something else, an ice cream cone. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The man in the moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that again reveals the extent to which the brain wants to place symbolic filters on things, and we need this. Right? Because I see you walk in the door, and Rick, I recognize you. In fact, we have a brain area, called the fusiform face gyrus, that it literally is a face recognition area. And you could be at any orientation, or I could just see your eyes and know that it's you. There's a phenomenon called propasognosia, where people can see faces. They can describe everything in the face, but they don't know, for instance, that it's JFK or Madonna or Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: It's quite the list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite the list, there you go, Lex. Run for office, Lex. Just kidding. It's hard enough to get you to respond to my texts as it is. So we have these filters, and so we're taking this cloud, and we're deciding what things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what I want to go drill into your process a little bit more deeply, when you approach a project-- so everyone meets each other, shakes hands. Here are the engineers. We're going to sit down. Everyone knows what they're doing, because you work with professionals. And you start going, are you trying to be with the cloud or in the implementation? Like where are you in that continuum? And forgive me if I'm like trying to surgically go into your process in a way that would disrupt it in any way. But I trust you been doing this for a while, and there's no threat of that. RICK RUBIN: I'm in the cloud, with the exception of I'm aware of what could go wrong on a technical side, and I might-- like if something good is happening, I might look over and make sure that we're rolling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's a leap over to here, momentarily, but then you get back. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. If I feel like-- if I was in the moment, I would be in the cloud. And if something good starts happening, it would trigger something in me. Like uh-oh, I hope this is-- I hope we're really doing this, because I don't know if we could ever do this again. That would be a thought of-- when the first time the real world would come into the picture would be something good is happening. Let's not lose it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And when that happens, do you-- never been in a studio besides a podcast studio. Do you say, hey, guys, that sounded good. More of that. Or do you wait, you let them continue? Because obviously you don't want to break their flow. RICK RUBIN: We'd never want to break any flow, once it's happening. Yeah. Once something's happening, just sit back and watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And do you think there's resonance, like the team of engineers and other people know when \"It,\" quote, unquote, is happening? RICK RUBIN: If everyone's paying attention, yes. When everyone's paying attention, it's usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, the thread will be something different than expected, and maybe not everybody would pick up on it. And that might be a particular-- that might be particular based on my taste or an artist's taste. Or someone involvement might say, let's listen back to that. I think that was better than we thought. That can happen. You said several things, and it was like you said enough for there to be several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I tend to do that. Sorry. Especially with you. I don't get to see you nearly as often as I would like, and so when I do, I confess that I'm a little bit of a kid in a candy shop. RICK RUBIN: I wrote down the brain tells us stories. So you talked about, I walk in, certain data points, you recognize me, but it's a real like looking at a cloud shorthand. We go through our lives doing this all day with everything we see, and the short hand, in the case of me, you know me, the shorthand turns out to be right. It checks out. If it's something we don't know and something we're not familiar with, something happens, we experience something on the street. Something happens, and it doesn't make sense. Something out of the ordinary happens. The first thing is this doesn't make sense. Then, what we do is, again, subconscious, unconsciously-- I don't know if it's unconscious or subconsciously-- without thinking, we create a story that explains what just happened, a hypothetical that makes it OK that what just happened happened. And oh, maybe he's running because his dog ran away, and he's chasing his dog. Maybe that's why he's running. And as soon as we have that thought of what it might be, we relax, because now it's not just a guy running, and this is weird. But it's a guy running, oh, he's probably running after his dog. And now, we register that story that we just made up, without even knowing we were making it up, as what happened. And then later in the day, if someone says, yeah, did you see that guy running out of the house? It's like, yeah, he was chasing his dog. I saw that. And you won't even realize that it was maybe hypothetical story that was the first possible explanation that allowed you to continue walking. Do you know what I'm saying? That's our whole lives. Our whole lives are reacting to things, making up a story of what we think may have happened, without realizing that's what we're doing. And then living the rest of our lives as if that thing that we made up really happened, and we never know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I completely agree. We confabulate from birth until death. There's this well-observed phenomenon in people who have memory deficits. So there's the sad example of this and then there's the everyday typical not-- who knows-- sad or not sad example. So for instance, if somebody has a slight memory deficit, or someone has Alzheimer's dementia, they'll find themselves in the hallway at night and say, what are you doing here? And they'll say, oh, I was going to get a glass of water, but they're walking away from the direction that would make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics who drink enough develop something called Korsakoff syndrome, where a certain brain area gets messed up. And you'll ask them a question, like oh, what are you doing here? And they will come up with incredible stories, sometimes interesting stories, that have no bearing on reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You ask them who their name is-- RICK RUBIN: But do they believe? They believe that's what happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: With 100% certainty, and this actually relates to a lot of the now better understood controversy around repressed memories. You can, especially from young people, you can pull memories from them of things that never happened. This has been demonstrated over and over again. So courtrooms know to be very cautious now about this whole notion of repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: That's good to know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, very, very complicated area of the law, as you can imagine. Because we tend to want to trust victims, for understandable reasons. But in terms of accuracy of details, two people have very different accounts of the same experiences, and this has been shown over and over again. That you can do well in the laboratory. It's pretty interesting. So again, because of this selective filtering and storytelling, and we are-- I think it was Salman Rushdie, who said we are the storytelling species. He probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow. I was going to say we're storytelling machines, but that's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. We are story-- I would say that the big five, if I had to pick up a brain function, is we are very limited filters. The mantis shrimp sees 67 shades of red for every one that we see. So they have access to things we don't have access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're not, as far as I releasing, albums of the Red Hot Chili Peppers caliber, but who knows. Maybe down there they are. I did see something, by the way as a relevant tangent recently, and I don't know if it's-- look, even if it's crazy, it's super cool. If you take a device that amplifies the electrical signals coming from cactus, and you just translate that into a simple rule of conversion to two or three pitches of sound, the music that comes out of it is beautiful, nothing short of beautiful. And when I saw that, the teenager in me thought, you know when we hear whale song, we think it's so beautiful. Like what if they're just like cursing at each other the whole time? Right? Maybe they're in there like a Rogen episode, when he invites all his comedian friends in there. Who knows? Maybe it's a psychoanalytic conversation about their childhood traumas. I don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But we decide, whale song is beautiful. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We decide cactus are just plants. RICK RUBIN: And it's beautiful to us, and we're right, that it is beautiful to us. But it doesn't mean we know anything about it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right. Yeah. So we have these filters, perceptual filters. We only can see and hear, smell and taste what we can, and then the brain likes to work in symbols. We tend to like to match that person whose shoes are messed up must be homeless. I've had a couple of instances in life where I saw what I thought was a homeless vagrant inside a building at an academic institution. It turned out, it was the most accomplished person in the field. That's always cool. Yes, that happened at Berkeley. Then, the other thing that we do is we tend to put symbol-- so we said perception, symbol representations, and then our memories are entirely confabulated, based on already deficient symbol and perceptual representation. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so I never liked the statement that we don't know how the brain works. I think we do know how the brain works, but that it works through very limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So knowing that and accepting it, and it seems to me that this idea of looking to nature, looking outside us, is so critical. And in fact, I hope you won't mind me sharing this, but a few years back, I had sent you something by text. And I was kind of in disbelief about something I had seen in the media. I was like, they got it all wrong. And I knew the person involved, and it was not a good situation for them. And I was like, they got it all wrong, and you wrote back. You said, it's all lies. Back to nature, the only truth. RICK RUBIN: Wow. That's wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I wrote that down. I put it over my desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I still-- I'd tattoo it on my forehead, if I didn't already have it well-committed to memory. But I know that's true. Right? Nature we can look at and it's-- RICK RUBIN: When I say it's all lies, you just talked about our ability to how limited our facility to see and understand what we see. Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. RICK RUBIN: So based on that, that leads us to we can't know much. Do you know what I'm saying? Our resolution is so low on everything that we're really just like we're grasping at straws. We have no idea. We have no idea, and there's great power and knowing that. Because if you think you know what's going on, chances are, you're being deceived. Not because somebody is deceiving you, but because they're telling you what they see, and they don't know. It's all-- do you know what I'm saying? It's all made up. Everything we know is made up. Maybe, maybe it's true. This brings us to pro wrestling. It's the reason that pro wrestling is closer to reality than anything else we can watch or any other content. It's we know it's made up. We know that it's a performance. It's storytelling, and that's how everything is, except we think wrestling is fake, and the world is real. Wrestling's real, and the world's fake. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You talk about in the book-- we're definitely going in this direction. In the book, you talk about this notion of entertaining the idea of the opposite being true. And there are not only emerging but established fields of psychology that are making great ground, I think, into the human psyche, Byron Katie's work and others. Where you take a statement, and you start playing with that statement. You poke at its authenticity. And when I first heard that, I thought, this is hokey. Right? It's just words. And then I realized how foolish I was being, because she's really on to something. And there are others too, of course, but in science, that's exactly what you do. You don't really ask questions in science. You are forced to raise hypotheses and try and say true or false. Now, there are limitations to that approach, certainly. Pure observational studies have been incredible in terms of what they've revealed to us, especially in medicine. A patient that has a bullet hole through a certain area of the brain, you don't go in and say, oh, I hypothesize that person will have a deficit in seeing faces. No. The person wandered into the clinic, and they go, this person sees faces but can't make sense of them. And then you reverse-- you forensically arrive at an understanding. So but in general, we go about things in this way, and considering that the opposite might be true, well, that's a little bit, I suppose, of like seeing the whale at the surface of the water. It's like, well, the opposite of my experience, which is all above water, for the most part, is maybe not the complete experience of life. You start seeing the inverse all the time. So I want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider the inverse all the time, and it really relates to the way that you described how we see colors is based on contrast. So maybe blue is only blue in relation to yellow. So if blue is our choice, if we're not considering yellow, blue doesn't exist. Do you know what I'm saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: It's like, we talk about night. It's only night, because there's day. If there was no day, there is no night. In all of our cases, it's like the yin yang. There's the light and the shadow always. There's always another side for everything, and we focus on one aspect. But if we look at the other aspect, chances are, we'll learn something too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The nervous system is not just able to do this. It's the way it does everything. Two experiments I'll just briefly describe. My scientific great grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, if you force a person to look at something for a long period of time without moving their eyes-- there's a way that you can do this-- the image disappears. Because normally, your eyes are making little microsecods, and you're comparing what you're seeing to what's right next to it. Pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We don't even have to use the example of pressing on the arm. We're sitting in chairs right now, and until I said you know what's going on at the level of sensation on the backs of your thighs, you were unaware of it. Because if you experience a pressure or a smell in a room, you ever walk in the smell is either good or not good, pretty soon, the smell disappears. The neurons are still firing like sledgehammers on a bell, but we become blind and deaf to it. Because the nervous system likes to habituate the value of that signal when it's there often, and it's only the stuff that comes through signal the noise that kind of jolts us into attention and awareness. And I want to return to attention awareness, which are prominent themes in the book. And I think, in an important way, not just, oh, attention awareness is important, but you also give insight into how to pay better attention, how to pay awareness with the understanding that people are going to go about it differently, but I do want to ask you about wrestling. Because when I was growing up, I lived South of the Cow Palace, and there was some wrestling going on there. I think back then it was WWF. There was a short stint in my childhood where I paid attention to, in particular, was it Koko B. Ware, the guy that had a Macaw? I was obsessed with tropical birds, and he would come in, and he put his tropical bird on the thing. And then George \"The Animal\" Steele, the guy that would eat the ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So and-- RICK RUBIN: I believe he was a professor. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was he really? RICK RUBIN: In real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: He was a professor, but he played Georgia \"The Animal\" Steele as a wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I loved the movie The Wrestler, The Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: With Mickey Rourke. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. One of the reasons I liked it is I once visited Asbury Park. Isn't that where that was filmed? There's a vacant-- he goes to visit his daughter. There's a vacant amusement park or abandoned amusement park scene there that was really eerie, still kind of haunts me a little bit. There's something about the East Coast in fall. All the places that people normally go just for the summer, that we don't have out here in the West coast, people in the East Coast are just tougher than we are. It still haunts me. Great movie. But I remember watching wrestling, and it was at that age, I think I was probably about 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, where you're entering puberty, and puberty is a fundamental landmark of development. It's the most rapid period of aging. It's also when we start to change our rule set. Like certain people and certain kinds of interactions take on profoundly different meaning. Right? It's not just a reproductive competence time, and when kids, their bodies change. The rulebook changes fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: Our understanding of the world changes in that moment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. The moment that a child understands really what sex is and how they got there and that a lot of the stuff that we see in the world is kind of passively, or not so passively, being sent through that filter, it's like it's something. It changes the rule book of perception. I view this age, from about 11 to 13, at least for me was a unique transition point. Where the gap between what I perceived as reality and fiction was blurry. This is captured pretty well in that movie \"Stand By Me,\" where they're hanging around the campfire at night. And the kid says, who do you think would win in a fight between Superman and Mighty Mouse? And the other kid says, like you idiot, Mighty Mouse is a cartoon. Of course Superman would win. And like to me, that's being 11 and 1/2 or 12 years old. Where your understanding of reality as you know it is changing, but it's not completely crystallized into an adult form reality. RICK RUBIN: That sounds like a really healthy place to be, to me, like that. Not letting it crystallize, I think there's where the downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I have a question specifically about wrestling, but it's really about process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I want to know whether or not you watch wrestling because it allows you to access the energy state in your body and mind and that mode of thinking in which reality, as one conceives it, is somewhat blurry. Or is it for a number of other reasons, which is fine. Is that the energy you're trying to export and bring to the creative process elsewhere, to life? Is it that anything is possible, or that we're dealing with archetypes? Because it doesn't matter if it's Koko B. Ware or Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage, or George \"The Animal\" Steele and the lovely Elizabeth. I guess I did watch a little bit of wrestling. They are archetypes, much like the Greek myths or the Bible or-- no disrespect to the Bible or to Greek myths or to wrestling, for that matter. Archetypes are a powerful filter for humans, but we know that they're a very limited filter too, because people aren't built like square wave functions. We have curves and contours and complexity. So what is the deal with your relationship to wrestling? RICK RUBIN: I think it maintains that playfulness. Anything is possible. We expect the unexpected all the time in wrestling. And it's a way to have a feeling of the energy of a sport with no competition. Everyone is working together to put on the best show they can. So it's more like a ballet than it is like a sporting event, and there's great skill involved. It's one of the few things that I can watch and really feel relaxed. It relaxes me. I don't feel like I have to think about it. I can just relax and enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This brings up a topic that is very near and dear to my heart, which is this notion of dopamine schedules. I never want to reduce everything to dopamine, but dopamine is the universal currency of delight, pleasure, motivation seeking. There are other chemicals involved too, but there's a beautiful experiment and a couple of examples that I'll use as a foundation to more questions about wrestling and why it's powerful. And why other people may want to use wrestling or some other endeavor as a way to access creative energy and source. Earlier, we talked about you can train an animal to press a lever three times and then get reward, and it will learn three is the magic number for reward, and then it can switch. It takes a little bit of training, and then they can switch. But they can't do prime numbers. They can't do high abstraction schedules. Humans either. We're not very good at figuring out the rule set for optimal foraging. We do it well enough to persist as a species, at least for now, but it's very likely that we are not tapping into that system as well as we could, and how would we know, if we don't know? It's one of those you who don't know what you don't knows. There's a beautiful experiment that explored when dopamine is released in the context of watching sport or watching comedy, believe it or not. And with the comedy stuff, it was every time there was a surprise, it was kind of that jarring like ha-ha, and they'd measure people's dopamine output. They were also brain imaging. In a game of basketball, it's a beautiful opportunity experimentally. Because every time one team gets the ball or is shooting free throws or something, they're going down court, and it's either going to end up in the basket, or it's not. Might end up on the free throw line, but it's end up or not. So what they found is that the schedule of anticipation was every time there was a switch of which team got it. So you're waiting, waiting, and then it's, ah. You're waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, and if something happened where it looked like they were going to make the three-pointer, but then somebody basically swatted the ball away, and then went for a half court shot, like you don't expect that very often, bigger dopamine release. So that's kind of how the dopamine thing works. When you describe wrestling, I wonder, because you don't know the script, it's not one team gets it, then the other team gets it. You don't know who's going to win. Anything could happen is what you said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The availability of that dopamine surge or drip, which is a powerful thing, is completely-- it's completely out of your reach in terms of anticipation. You don't know when it's going to come, but it must arrive often enough that you return to it 11 hours a week of watching. In many ways, the way I'm starting to conceptualize the creative process is a little bit the same. You don't know where those nuggets of gold and those loose threads are, but you have enough experience-- and in this case, I am referring to you specifically-- to know that they are in there. The people walking in this room have a certain level of ability and talent to create that the map will form itself, as we are going through the voyage. And those nuggets of-- here I'm calling them dopamine-- but they are out there, and that knowledge is enough to get you to come back again and again to trust the process. So I actually think the way you described wrestling as it's the energy of the sport. It's not whether or not it's this move or that move or who wins or who loses. It's the energy, and I'm guessing it's the energy that it creates in you as an observer. RICK RUBIN: Yes. It's the energy creates in me, and the reality that it's honest in what it is, in a world where seemingly nothing is honest at what it is. And again, not because people are lying all the time. We have little data, we make up a story to explain it, and then we say that's what happened. And we have trusted sources who do exactly what I just described and who pass this down as gospel of what we teach. And maybe it's true, and maybe it's not. With wrestling, we know, maybe it's true, maybe it's not. We lean towards it not being true, but what's really interesting about wrestling, and maybe one of the most fun things about it, is that, sometimes, real life works its way into the story. Like two wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: In real life. RICK RUBIN: Well, we don't know. It's like you never know. It's like in the storyline, they're getting married or getting divorced, or best friends turn on each other. And it could be part of the story, and it could really be happening, because they do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks their leg. So they're out, because their leg is broken. Did they break their leg? We don't know. They're out. Do you know what I'm saying? We're told they broke their leg. So there's always this like I wonder what's true? I wonder where the line is. We know that it's scripted and/or predetermined. That's how they say, it's predetermined. But we don't know where reality is and isn't, and in some ways, that's our real experience of the world, is this we don't really know where reality is and isn't. We have an idea, maybe. I think in some ways, wrestling's more honest or legitimate, because we start with the idea that it's fixed. When we go to a boxing match, we don't go to a boxing match thinking it's fixed. Yet, it might be, and historically, it's happened. Or there was just something in baseball where-- was it baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't follow baseball. I should know. RICK RUBIN: It was just a big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK RUBIN: One of the teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: The plays, basically. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was it the call signals of the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Of the catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. You're not supposed to deprogram the-- or deconstruct the call signals of the other team, and I guess maybe a team got caught doing that. RICK RUBIN: Yes, and the team that won whatever the World Series was. So it's like, with wrestling, that wouldn't be a scandal. Do you know what I'm saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, and that's what the world is really like. So in some ways, it's comforting, and there's still this mystery of like, wow, I wonder if that's true or not, because we never really know. If someone gets hurt, did they really break their back, or are they just going on vacation? We don't know. We'll never know. It's fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is fascinating, and I feel like there are certain people who show up in a way that is surprising in not just one direction but in all directions. Like it's one thing for a celebrity to come out and make a statement. That can be interesting or not interesting, depending on the celebrity and the statement and the delivery. And I'm probably going to get this wrong, because I'm terrible at pop culture things, most of them anyway. But as I recall, Lady Gaga showed up to some event wearing an outfit made of meat, and I can't tell you for the life of me whether or not that was a statement against meat or for meat. Maybe, it was a statement for the carnivore diet. Maybe, it was a statement for veganism. I don't know. RICK RUBIN: Or maybe neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or maybe neither, but it was definitely a statement in that it broke with the norm. And it said to me, OK, she creates different rules for herself or breaks boundaries that other people had. I never heard of anyone doing that before. It doesn't mean they hadn't, but I never heard of anyone doing it before. But we do tend to associate outside the current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless it crosses a line, in which case, it becomes something else. It becomes almost theater for sake of theater. But what you're telling me is that, within the realm of wrestling, theater is the goal, at some level, and everybody knows it who goes into those arenas, who watches it. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And everyone agrees to kind of suspend outside reality and say this is reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, and they boo for the bad guys and cheer for the good guys, knowing that backstage they're probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except for the kids that are 11, who think it's really real. RICK RUBIN: I don't know. I don't even know if they know. I'm not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The only other person I know who has vocalized their love of professional wrestling to the extent that you have is Lars Frederiksen, the rhythm guitar player for Rancid who loves wrestling. But his statement-- and forgive me, Lars, if I'm getting this wrong-- is that, because he grew up in an area of the South Bay, where there were no teams. Like now, there's the San Jose Earthquakes, but there was no football team in San Jose. He's from Campbell. But there were no like good teams, no sports teams, but they had wrestling, and he had it where? On the television set. And so if you didn't have a-- like I didn't grow up with any organized sports thing. The 49ers were up the road, but for me, it was skateboarding, and I love it for the same reason. You actually never really know what's going to happen. There is no rulebook. The rulebook is made up, but they are very-- it's a unique sport, in that-- surfing's a bit like this too-- in that, they are absolutely maniacal about making things look a certain way. It's not about just doing it. It's about doing it and making it look good. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching it with the front foot, and the trends change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: It's a style. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, and that style is this like nebulous thing of like in fashion or in sports. Right. Whereas with a football, there's some amazing catches. There's even like the catch, which I happen to know is a 49er-- the catch during the Super Bowl. But in general, it's like the goal is get in the end zone, win the game. And I'm sure football players are like cringing as I say this, but it doesn't matter if you run ugly, if you run fastest. In skateboarding, that would never fly. In fact, you'd basically be ridiculed out of the sport. In wrestling, is it the same? Are there style to wrestling? RICK RUBIN: It's all performance. It's all the charisma of the people involved. There's the physical ability, the ability to talk and tell a story, and how charismatic the performers are. Whether you want to watch them, whether you want to see them win, whether you want to see them lose, and whether you're interested in cheering or booing for them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was going to say it reminds me of opera, but operas get released over and over again. You know the story and how it ends when you walk in, if you've listened to it before. So wrestling does seem to be unique in that way. It's real time iteration, at least from the perspective of the-- RICK RUBIN: And it's real time iteration based on because people get hurt all the time. They're doing really crazy physical stuff. So if someone gets hurt, the story has to change. Because in real life, they can't show up next week and do what was planned in the script. So it's very alive, and there's a lot of-- something interesting and unexpected is always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, in a much more calm form, I'll share with you something, I'd just like your perspective on it. For years, I used a tool in order to try and access ideas, since I was a little kid actually, because I have a little bit of OCD, a little bit of a Tourette's. When I get tired, I'll do that. I'm very strategy implementation oriented. I had that when I was a little kid, I needed all my stuffed animals arranged in a certain way. LEGOs had to be-- a little neurotic or a lot. And then science is very much about you have to do things with a lot of precision. And I discovered that the ultimate reset for me when I was in graduate school or a postdoc if I couldn't make it to a really good agnostic front show, or like chaos. The chaos of a punk rock show for me was this reset. It was to release all this thing. And I got energy from it. First time I saw Transplants play, it's was, whoa, because you don't know what's going to happen. And it was scary. And I loved it. The other thing that I used over time to reset this ability to think in a structured way without it feeling like it was overcoming me, maybe even access the same thing in some ways that you're accessing with wrestling was I like to stare at aquaria. I like to go to aquariums or I'd build aquariums. And I would just sit there because you never know which way the fish are going to go. You think it's going that way, but then all of a sudden they'll turn and go the other way. It's completely unpredictable. And I love aquaria because of the tranquility and had them in my lab for a long time. I just adore aquariums because of the non-linearity of it. It's not A, B, C. It's A, Z, Z, Q. And I think this is what some people try and access through psychedelics, but that didn't seem to me like a very good way to do it on a regular basis, whereas with aquaria, the tanks are there. So in your book, you talk about something that I also share a love for, which is how the ocean and aspects of nature like clouds and ocean, they have a predictability to them. We know where they are and where to find them. Fortunately, the sun rises and sets every day, at least for now. And we can count on them with 100% reliability. And yet, they are from the perspective of what physicists would say, they're very chaotic. You can't look at a wave and know exactly how the foam is going to roll out. You know it's going to roll in and roll out. We have the tides, but when I hear about wrestling, I think about my love of aquaria. And I think about my love of punk rock music, for instance, or I think about the ocean. I think in that way that we actually have a need to source from things that have both a combination of structure and no structure. RICK RUBIN: I think it's interesting that there are some places that don't change and some places that change a lot. And I can remember thinking about this. I was walking-- there's a beach that I walk on in Hawaii, that I walk on every morning when I'm there. And if you walk on the same beach every day, you get a sense of what it's like. And I remember I was in Hawaii. I walked on the beach every day for a year or however long it was. And then I left for six months, then I came back. And the next time I walked on the beach, it was an entirely different beach, entirely different. And I remember thinking in that moment like this is an unusual place because I pictured the house that I didn't even grow up in, the house I lived in maybe for the first seven years of my life. And I think about what the backyard looked like. And I think about a particular old tree that was there. And I don't know this for sure, but my sense is, if I were to go back to where I grew up, and go to that place, and look in that yard, it would probably look pretty similar. Yet, here was this beach that I was walking on in Hawaii that in the course of six months completely changed its face. And just how interesting both of those things are. And that depending on the project we're working on, to be able to go to a place that we know has the potential to change a lot and what that would do to our connection with the Earth when we're experiencing that versus going to a place that has very little change. And you can count on it being the way it's always been. That both of those are interesting things to be able to draw upon depending on what we want to open in our psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have an almost unhealthy fascination with New York in the mid '80s and '90s. RICK RUBIN: You didn't live there, though. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but since I was a kid-- I went there when I was a little kid. And I was fascinated by it. There's also a very interesting migration of East Coast to West Coast creatives, including yourself, that played an important part in my life just seeing things and hearing things that were meaningful to me. But I, for instance, I love the movie-- I haven't seen the documentary about Jean-Michel Basquiat, Basquiat, because of the characters that are in it, and the huge number of people in that like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Wall, and on, and on. Those images of New York at that time are so exciting and what was happening. I wish I could transplant myself to that. If I had a time machine, that's where I'd land first. I hear a lot of people say, New York isn't what it used to be. San Francisco isn't what it used to be, whatever. LA isn't what-- there does seem to be something that feels a little bit disruptive to people about cities changing. But the idea that natural landscapes change is actually-- we even accept like, hey, fires sweep through places. And assuming they weren't started by humans, we accept that. That change and the reordering of landscapes is normal and healthy. And I always tell myself, you have the kids growing up in New York, or San Francisco, or Chicago now. They only know it that way. So to them, it's as cool or as uncool as it's ever going to be. They either want to get out or they're loving every piece of it. And this happened for all the people that came before us. So my question is a very basic one. Do you miss the New York that you came up in? Are you somebody who is attached to the past? RICK RUBIN: I'm not attached at all. I'm not attached to anything in the past. I don't look back at all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You don't think about, oh, in my dorm room at NYU, Beastie Boys, this. I miss-- no. Your optics are forward, present and forward. RICK RUBIN: Only present and forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there a process to that or it just happens to be where you default to? RICK RUBIN: I don't know. I'm not sure, but that's how I do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia is not in Rick Rubin's brain. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I say that with genuine admiration. So you can hear a song that maybe you had a role in producing or not, something from the past. And you're accessing a state, presumably, but you're not pining for wishing how it was. RICK RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm no psychologist, but I'm going to venture to say that I think that's a very unique quality. I think a lot of people wish for or wish that things did not happen the way they did, that there's a lot of living in the past. There's a lot of this notion of people future trip. I don't actually think that's the default state of the brain. I think a lot of people live in emotional anchors to the past, good and bad. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. I have none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And watching wrestling is one way that you cleanse the palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When you go to a meal and you-- they pass around this or that-- I don't know if they do this anymore, but pass around a little bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate. It turns out there's a biological reason for that. There's a kind of neutralization of the taste receptors between savory, and sweet, et cetera. So wrestling is your palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: I know that if I watch wrestling before I go to sleep, it's going to be a good night's sleep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you dream about wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. But it's just relaxing. It's just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you anticipate when you watch it, like here comes the dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes when it happens it's exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's going up for the three-pointer. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, sometimes it's exciting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But do you enjoy-- RICK RUBIN: But even then, it's like the stakes are low. It's like I don't really care what happens, which feels good. I'm just being entertained. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do they actually get hurt sometimes? You said they do. RICK RUBIN: A lot, often. They do. I mean, they're basically stunt men. So imagine stuntmen getting hurt doing a crazy stunt. It happens all the time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When the movie The Wrestler, I remember he got staples stapled into him. And I thought that's pretty intense. I once went and saw-- I guess they called it Mexican wrestling. I don't know if they call it that anymore, where the guys dip their hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, they dip their hands in glass. This was in Sacramento. And I once saw it. I honestly didn't have a stomach for it. I really didn't. I couldn't believe it was legal. It might not have been legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I thought-- RICK RUBIN: There's crazy stuff in wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. So before sleep, is that typically when you watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you think it's useful for people to have some activity that allows them to clear their mind and create peace before heading off to sleep? RICK RUBIN: I think so. And I think yoga nidras would be good. It's like yoga nidra, pro wrestling, any of those type things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching the Dahmer thing. I won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: I don't watch any horror, anything, or I don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I know it exists. I know horrible things happen in the world, but I certainly don't want to do that before sleep. I think these liminal states before and emerging from sleep are very powerful. When you wake up in the morning, are your thoughts immediately structured or do you enjoy the clearing of the clouds? RICK RUBIN: It's a slow process for me to wake up. And I like that. I like not engaging too much too soon. I usually fall asleep listening to a lecture or something speaking because if I don't, I can get caught in my own thoughts. And listening to something is enough of a focus point that it stops me from talking to myself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I do the same. My grandfather listened to the radio, to sports on the radio. And he would fall asleep. Oftentimes, he was a smoker with a cigarette in his mouth. His wife's responsibility was to stay up later than he did to make sure he didn't burn everything down. And then when you wake up, you said it's a slow process. Is it an hour or two before you feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: I would say probably an hour. I usually wake up and try to get in the sun as soon as I possibly can and hope to spend-- hope to spend about an hour. And then I'll usually go for a walk on the beach for another hour or 90 minutes, depending. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you with family members and other people at that time? RICK RUBIN: No, I'm usually focused by myself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: I'll be listening to something. I don't look at the phone, but I listen to, again, a lecture, or podcast, or audiobook. I like audiobooks a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I do too. If an idea comes to mind do you write it down? RICK RUBIN: I may, it depends. I like to. I usually have-- would do a note in my phone. I don't usually carry pen and paper with me when I'm walking. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I do the same. I do a long Sunday hike or jog. And I will audio script into my phone. People sometimes give me funny looks because I'm talking to myself. RICK RUBIN: That's a nice way to do it, though. I'd like to learn more of the audio methods of doing it instead of the typing methods. Right now I type and I don't think it's the best way. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The voice memos function in the iPhone and other phones is really good. And there are now companies like rev.com that will turn those into Word docs scripts that are fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, they're not a sponsor of the podcast. I just happen to use it. It's great. I actually learned that trick from Richard Axel, the Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. He writes manuscripts by walking around his office, pacing, and talking into his phone. RICK RUBIN: I always think of the Woody Allen movie where the Alan Alda character is talking about-- yeah, he's speaking comedy ideas into the phone. It's really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I liked that movie about Harvey Milk, that Sean Penn played Harvey Milk, because that all took place before I was alive, mostly, in the Bay Area. But there's these beautiful scenes of him, as I recall, sitting there at his kitchen table talking into a tape recorder at night, talking about how he predicted that he would be possibly assassinated, et cetera. And this goes back to the Strummer thing about writing things down. I think that a lot of people, including myself feel a little bit of egotistical guilt around, who am I to think that my ideas could be worthwhile or something? But I think over time, I've come to realize that the ideas about experiments or questions I have about health, they don't always, but oftentimes can lead to real seeds that grow into big trees. RICK RUBIN: But it's something that's interesting to you, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Most of my notes are not for anyone else's-- for anyone else's used. Like I hear about something that's interesting to me and I think about, OK, I want to learn more about this, whatever it is. And then, sometimes those things work their way into things I'm doing because the universe seems to work in that way, but I rarely am learning something with the idea of using it. I learn things with the idea of, this is what I want to know. This is what's interesting to me. And then often those things that are interesting to me can find their way into other projects just because they do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, that's almost like coal or kindling, but the moment that you think of it that way, it sounds so extractive. So you take this walk and you're writing down the occasional idea, perhaps. And then what is the next-- the way that-- here are less than, do this, then this, then that. I'm interested in, where does your mind shift to? Does it become more structured as the day goes on? Does your thinking become more structured around projects and plans? RICK RUBIN: I try to deal with things that need dealing with after that and in preparation for going to work. And then when I go to work, it's more like free-- this free thing where I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention, and maybe trying to will it to happen, but knowing I don't have the ability to make it happen. I can just be present for it and be ready if it does arrive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Some of the more surprising and I found really interesting and useful features of the book were about dancing with structure and lack of structure. So when I think of structure, I think of deadlines. So when you are in the process of creating something, obviously, deadlines are relevant, time of day. There's only so many hours in the day where one can stay in the groove or the readiness to receive. Have you ever found yourself in that mode where you're grinding like, oh, here we are. OK, I'm not coming home for dinner. It's the next-- we're going to push, put on the coffee pot kind of thing. RICK RUBIN: A lot. A lot. Over the course of my life, a lot, not as much now. And one of the things that I discovered through working on the book was the phases of work-- we're not required to treat the different phases of work in the same way, whereas before, I did. Before, everything was in this state of play. Everything had a wide open time schedule. It happens when it happens. And if it takes two years or three years, it doesn't matter. It's not about that. It's only about this thing has to be great. And what I came to realize in working on the book is that there are different phases. And the first phase is this seed collecting phase, which is an ongoing part of life in general. I do that. I do that always whether I'm working on something or not. I'm always in the seed collecting phase. And there's no deadline or just anything that interests me that I think I want to learn more about or has potential to be something, anything. I hear something, I think, uhm, I'd like to read more about that, or I wonder if there's a movie about that. Is there a movie about that? If not, maybe there's a movie to be made. Again, I want-- this is something I want in my life. Let's see if it exists. If it doesn't exist, then maybe that's something interesting to pursue. But I know that the desire is there because I have it. So in the seed phase, there's no deadlines. It's just a wide open part. And then the next phase is called the experimentation phase, where we start experimenting to see what the seeds want to do. You're involved but you're more of a-- you're not really dictating the action. You're setting the stage for something to happen, but it's not about you yet. So it'd be like the equivalent of you'd plant the seed. You'd would water it. You'd make sure it was in the sun. And you'd wait. So you're involved, but you can't make it grow. And then when it sprouts, and it grows, or if it turns into a plant, then you can look at the plants like, OK, how does this plant-- what's the potential of this plant? And then that the third phase is the crafting phase, where it's like, OK, I have this plant, maybe I'm going to trim it or maybe I'm going to combine it with these other plants to make something else with it. Now, it's like material that you have. And then finally is the completion or finishing phase, which is the final edit, getting to the version of it-- the version of it that's the one that you can share with the world if that's something you're going to do. And I've come to realize that by the time you're going into the completion phase, you can have a deadline. And it won't hurt the project. In fact, it might help the project. And I didn't know that before. So I've worked on projects that have gone longer than they necessarily needed to and maybe not in the best interests of the project because I didn't know that. I didn't understand the timing of that because I am so aware of the necessity in the experimental phase to not have a deadline that I assumed that held through the whole project. And they're not-- it's not a clear phase one finishes, and then you start phase two. Phase two finishes and you start phase three. You move back and forth between them. I'm collecting seeds all the time. I'm always in phase one. And then, probably to some degree, there's always some version of experimentation going on, maybe not now, but if something's on a list of things I want to look at, hopefully, I'll get to the list and give them some experimentation and see what they can turn into. And then if they do turn into something, then they get to the crafting phase where it's more, OK, now I have this thing. What do I know about this thing? What can I match this with? What can I use this for? How can I be involved as a craftsman? And by the end of the crafting phase or deep into the crafting phase, you can start seeing the end. You can start seeing an end. And then you can even dictate an end. But I recommend, if you do, just dictate it for you not for anyone else because if something comes up where you learn-- if you set a deadline, public deadline, and then a new discovery happens along the way. And you realize, oh, this could actually be much better than I thought, but I need more time, it's harder to do that if you set the deadline. So I would say, have an internal deadline to get to finish it. That said, if an unusual situation comes up and it's better for everything not to meet that deadline, it's one of those rules that-- you set the rule to break it if it's what's best for the project. But that was a new thing for me. And it helped me a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When did you realize that? RICK RUBIN: In collecting the material for the book and thinking about it. When I realized that it was phases-- I didn't know any of this. When I started writing the book, I didn't know hardly any of the things in the book. Most of it would be reverse engineering something that I had experienced, a successful experience using these methods without knowing they were methods, just following my instincts got me to something good. And then I would look back at, why did I want to do that? And is there a principle at play that could be of use outside of this case? And how do I explain that? And that's what the book is, these reverse engineered principles that have led to a good decision making and try and make things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The chapter on self-doubt was really interesting to me. RICK RUBIN: Tell me what it says because I can't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'll read the first sentence of it, which is that self-doubt lives in all of us. And while we may wish it was gone, it is there to serve us. And it goes on to describe how to dance with self-doubt in not so many words. I think there's a saying that is actually from the landscape of psychology, which is generally discussed in a pathological context, which is, if nothing matters, anything goes. This is usually the phrase used to describe people who feel as if there's no use in living, so just go crazy, often to self destruct. But there's a light version of this, I realize, where in some sense the creative process seems to have something to do with-- if you're not paying attention to what outcomes are like who likes it, who doesn't like it, and you're just doing it for you, you make the rule play, I want to delight myself. Well then, anything goes and you have an infinite rule set there to extract from, at least initially. So as one gets better at their craft, you can imagine self-doubt goes down. I think that's the perception of a lot of people. You get better at what you're doing. You can land free throws as a basketball player. You can hit more home runs as a baseball player. You can produce more platinum albums as an artist. Self confidence goes up. Self-doubt goes down. But I think you and I both know a number of people who are successful enough to know that oftentimes there's a mirror image to that, where people feel pressure because they did it once now they got to do it again. RICK RUBIN: Yes or that you think you're so good at it that it comes easily and you don't have to apply yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. So self-doubt it's like a-- it's a check on yourself. It can either be really helpful or it can undermine you. So it's something we all have. And if we let it undermine us, then we don't make anything and that's not good. But when used as a balancing tool in our lives, it serves a great function where we really do-- it's OK to have all the confidence in the world and still second guess, is this the best it can be? You can doubt-- I think the phrase is in the book. You can doubt your way to a great work, to a masterpiece. Sometimes that questioning allows you to push further than just accepting, I made it so it's good. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I've encountered more people that seem to be driven by self-doubt and the need to constantly perform and perform again, then I have real arrogance. Just hasn't been my experience, fortunately. I've met some arrogant people in my life. And of course, we never-- as a psychiatrist who I admire a lot and bio-engineer who was a guest on this podcast Carl Di Saraf said, we never really know how other people feel. I mean, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel. Again, language is a very deprived format for explaining feelings. So we think somebody feels one way but we can observe-- and it could be another, but we observe their behavior. So in the sense of returning to the work, just always returning to process, it sounds like your routine is fairly scripted, at least now. But the things that you are getting in touch with-- wrestling, sleep and dreaming, the ocean, there's a predictability of them because you can access them in a predictable way, but they seem to have a lot of unpredictability in them. The ocean is completely unpredictable. RICK RUBIN: I also listen to a lot of music that I don't know. So I listen to a lot of classical music, and less so but some jazz, and a lot of old music that I never heard before. And I like being surprised by music. And sometimes it really catches me off guard. I shazam a lot when I hear something I like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Have you ever encountered music that really works well live but just does not work in a recording? Or that it's much better live but the recording is sort of, meh. You don't have to name names. RICK RUBIN: I don't think so. I feel like maybe there are some artists who are great live who've never captured it well on record. Example would probably be the Grateful Dead is a good example of a band where I feel like their albums are not their strong point. But if you hear live recordings, they're really interesting and really different from each other. And that's part of what makes the Grateful Dead interesting is their unpredictability. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I confess. I had a sister who listened to the Grateful Dead. And I got taken to a few shows when I was younger. And they would do that-- was it called space? It was these drum solos that would go on for hours and hours. This is like the antithesis of punk rock shows, where songs are like 90 to 120 seconds. And I remember thinking, what is this? What is this? But people I know, who love the Grateful Dead, love that uncertainty about where that drum thing-- I think they do call it space. Forgive me deadheads. I'm not enough of one to get it right. RICK RUBIN: But they're looking for something. And sometimes they find it. And if you're there when they find it, it feels exciting because it's not just-- it's not just following a script. It's like something is really happening. It's a real moment. Something that I aim for in the studio is to create real moments that when you hear them, they don't necessarily sound perfect. They sound like something that really happened. And in that moment, something happened. And it's a special moment. And you can feel that if they were to play it again, it wouldn't be like that. There's something really exciting about that. It's really what-- it's how jazz works as well. And I think some of-- bringing some of that jazz mentality into other types of music is really interesting, makes for compelling things, because when you hear them, there's a certain amount of-- you really have to pay attention to do it. When you're doing it, you're really paying attention. It's like, I don't really know. There's no music. There's no map to follow. And now we're working together to make something. Do I play or not play? When do I play? And you're really paying attention. And can I add or you go to start adding something. And someone else added something. It's like, oh, I can't do that. And it's like everyone's just in this thing, in this moment experiencing this thing at once that you can feel as a listener. And we get to hear their excitement of finding it. And it's thrilling when it happens. So I like that experience. I feel that's what the Dead do live. They'll play songs in different ways. And again, I don't know very much about the Dead. It's newer for me to listen to the Dead. Growing up, I never listen to the Dead, but probably because I heard songs on their albums and thought, this doesn't really speak to me. But I think that the albums don't really reflect what's special about them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think a lot of their shows were recorded or videotaped-- RICK RUBIN: By fans which they supported. They supported that everybody come, everybody tape, everybody trade tapes. It made sense for who that band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They redefined or they defined-- excuse me, the notion of followers. I mean, people literally gave up their lives or spent much of their lives literally driving from city to city to follow them. RICK RUBIN: Because it's not like going from city to city to watch a movie over and over because it's not a movie. It's different every night. It's changing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's pretty incredible phenomenon. I don't know of anything else quite like it except cults. And those often don't end well. I think a guy that mixed the punch for the Jonestown Massacre went to my high school. RICK RUBIN: Is that true? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think so. RICK RUBIN: That's amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: My sister is really good at all this '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. She's a very light person. RICK RUBIN: Did you read Season of the Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: It's about San Francisco in the '60s. It's great. You'll love it. Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I ought to check it out. The way you describe experiences going by in time, or things emerging in time, and the creative process being a way of capturing those moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera, I thought was beautifully captured in the analogy you gave about a conveyor belt going by of things. We think of the creative process like it's going to land in us, or we're going to enter it, or that we're going to sit there in a chair and grit our teeth. There's some Hemingway quote where you just sit there and stare at the page until the beads of blood form on your forehead or something, maybe it was him, maybe it was-- I don't know. It sounds like Bukowski or something. Anyway, I'm going to get this wrong. People tell me in the comments. Maybe no one said it. It was a dream. But I love this conveyor belt thing. That reminds me of being in laboratory, doing experiments thinking I was trying to solve one thing, and then seeing something else, and then having to make the decision, like is that really cool enough to drop everything and go that direction, or to spend a night, or a week, or a career going that way? I mean, these are big decisions, given that at least as far as we know, we're going to live 100 years or less. But this idea that we have thoughts and experiences in our past. And we can draw on, and try, and make good decisions-- do we grab these things off the conveyor or not? I'm hearing you. And I'm starting to realize that being attached to the past might be the worst thing that one could do in terms of being able to make good decisions in this context, because we have a playbook of what's worked and what hasn't worked. But you actually talk about this-- there's a passage in the book that-- I'll just read it. To be aware of the assumption that the way you work is the best way simply because it's the way you've done it before. I sat with this page for almost 10 full minutes, which is not something I do very often. Maybe you could elaborate on this a little bit. I mean, we want to have mechanisms and routines we can trust, but this is, I think, an important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah when something works, it's easy to be fooled into believing that's the way to do it or that's the right way. It's just a way. And it's just a way that happened to work that time. And this plays into when you get advice from people who have more experience than you. You explain your situation. They tell you their advice. The advice that they're giving you is not based on your life or your experience. It's based on their life and their experience. And the stories that they're telling are based on experiences they've had, that have very different data points than yours. So maybe they're giving you good advice, but maybe they're giving you good advice for them and not giving you good advice for you. And it's easy when we try something and have a result, a positive result thinking, everybody can do this. The way I was vegan for a long time, 22 years. And then I started eating-- I started eating animal protein and then eventually changed my diet a few times to the point where I lost a lot of weight. The way that I did it worked for me. Right before that happened, I did something that I was told that everyone else who did what you did, they all lost weight, for whatever reason, I didn't. So the idea that we know what's right for someone else-- I think, it's hard enough to even figure out what's right for ourselves. And if we do somehow crack the code of what's right for us, be happy we have it, and then still know, I wonder if that's the only way. Maybe there's an even better way that we're not considering. Not to get comfortable with thinking we know how it works just because we get the outcome we want. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was raised in science with a principle. It was literally dictated to me as a principle, almost like a rule of religion, which was that the brain is plastic. It can change and learn until you're about 25. And then the critical periods end and that's it. And this was a rule. Essentially, it was dictated a Nobel Prize, which was very deserved, given to my scientific great grandparents. They deserve it. But I was told there was no changing of brain structure function in any meaningful way after age 25 or so. It turns out that's completely wrong. Sorry David and Torsten, but they knew it was wrong. RICK RUBIN: Wow, that's interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, it was actively suppressed because of the competitive nature of prizes and discoveries at that time. And a guy named Mike Merzenich and his student, Gregg Recanzone were showing that adult plasticity exists and only now is this really starting to emerge as a theme, just crazy. There were so many reasons and the textbooks said it. We were all told it. And it changed our behavior. Now we know this to be completely false. There's plasticity throughout the lifespan. There's limits to it here and there, but it's just far and away a different story. RICK RUBIN: So why would that be the only time that ever happened? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. But the field was run by a very small cabal of people at that time. RICK RUBIN: All fields are run by a very small cabal of people who have an investment in things being the way they are now because they're in charge. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And one of the great things about getting older is that-- well, fortunately, everyone eventually ages. And I hope that-- David unfortunately passed away. He was lovely. Torsten is lovely. He's still alive. And they would say-- I think Torsten would say, yeah, we should have been a little more open or kind in allowing these other ideas. But I think that-- RICK RUBIN: But just think about all the years that were wasted with this misunderstanding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. And it went beyond that. And there were BBC specials that helped propagate this. And one of the goals of the podcast has been to try and shed, shine light on ideas that at first seem crazy. I know you and I are both semi-obsessed with the health benefits of light. And you hear about this stuff like negative ion therapy. It sounds crazy, right? Sounds like something you would only hear about at Esalen or in Big Sur. Turns out negative ionization therapy for sleep and mood is based on really amazing work out of Columbia by a guy named Michael Terman. The Nobel Prize, I think it was in 1916, was given for phototherapy for the treatment of lupus. This idea that certain wavelengths of light can help treat medical conditions is not a new idea. But somehow, we see a red light. We're not used to seeing red lights except in sunsets and on stoplights. And somehow, it bothers people or it makes them feel like-- RICK RUBIN: It undermines a business model that doesn't take red light into consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Until it does and then it was-- and then it's co-opted there. And the place what I look to is acupuncture. For a lot of years, people said, well, acupuncture, this is like no mechanism, no mechanism, no mechanism. There's a lab at Harvard, a guy named Qiufu Ma, who I reasonably well, whose laboratory is dedicated to trying to figure out the biological mechanisms of acupuncture. And they are discovering what everyone is known for thousands of years, which is that incredible effects on anti-inflammation, the gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN: I have a friend who was having a terrible back problem. And I suggested that he see an acupuncturist. And he went to the acupuncturist that I suggested. And his back problem completely healed almost instantaneously. And I asked him, have you been keeping up, because he had another flare up. He's like, no. I can't go back there because acupuncture doesn't work. I said, well, you saw it work for you. He's like, yeah, but there's no science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, he's got it-- now there's good science and published in premier journals. What's interesting is there's a little bit of science editorial, but since we like to exchange information about health and things of that sort, the editorial staff of a journal dictates what gets published and what doesn't. And the premier journals have an outsized effect on what the media covers. And so the beautiful thing is the journal staff now is of the age that they grew up hearing about acupuncture, hypnosis has a powerful clinical effect if it's done right, yoga nidra and similar practices. And so the tides are changing, but I sometimes like to take a step back and think, what are we confronted with now that seems crazy that in 10 years, the kids that will be the-- because to me they're kids, will be journal editors. I'm like, oh yeah, absolutely. I'm making this up but putting tuning forks against your head or something like that, like sound wave therapy. I think when one adopts a stance of-- we have to filter everything through the limitations of our biology, but also through the sociology, the way culture goes, it becomes a different story. How do you deal with that, not just in terms of health, but in terms of thinking about anything? It sounds like you don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what people are going to think is cool or not. RICK RUBIN: No, I can't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're a punk rocker at heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You still are there, I got you. RICK RUBIN: I can't. I just know what I like and what I don't. I know what works for me and what doesn't. I try things. And I'm constantly looking for new better solutions to anything. And wherever they come from doesn't matter. It could come from-- it could come from Stanford or it could come from the guy talking to himself on the street. If it works, I'm good. It doesn't really matter to me at all. I don't hold any of it tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, there's now a division of the National Institutes of Health called complementary and alternative health. And it's amazing. NCCIH is run by a woman who has published on-- this is interesting, some of the anti-cancer effects of things like acupuncture, not that acupuncture can cure all cancers, but real data that I think for a lot of people, certainly of the generation above us, they just are not interested. It sheds new light on the Andrew Wiles, the Paul Stametses, the wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy, there are so many. There's so many we can look at. I mean for a long time, nutrition was just thought of as something that doesn't matter what you eat. It's what medicine you take and what-- the food is everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food is a powerful variable. In the landscape of online nutrition, it's one of the third rails for anyone like myself who's out there on social media. You do a very good job of putting out posts on Twitter and Instagram, but each day you take it down, you put up a new one. RICK RUBIN: And I don't talk about any-- I only talk about-- I talk about creative ideas. I don't talk about anything specific related to anything other than maybe something like, don't believe what you hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's right, exactly. Well, in the landscape of nutrition sometimes I now place it through the filter of professional wrestling. You've got your vegans, and your omnivores, and your carnivore MD. And you've got liver king. And you've got everything in between. So you could translate that to any number of different areas. Fashion probably has its people. I'm just not aware of who they are. Music has theirs. And sports has theirs. And science has theirs characters. So are we all just pro-wrestling characters in these different domains and we're taking ourselves and each other way too seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, it's all-- we don't know anything. If someone has an idea and it sounds interesting, do you try it. And if it doesn't work, it's OK and try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're an empiricist. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. And if something seems interesting to you and you're excited by it, why not try it? I try very fringy things. I like, in some ways, the more unrealistic it seems, the more interesting it is to me because I feel like that's getting closer to something that somebody doesn't want me to know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But you're not a big drug guy like the big psychedelic craze that's happening now and that happened some years. RICK RUBIN: I'm not against it. It's just has never been something that I've done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting area that's definitely making headway inside of standard academic science and medicine now. RICK RUBIN: I'm interested in non-pharmacological approaches to things, whatever they are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm a big believer that also that behavioral do's and don'ts, first, are that they're the most fun to explore because, in general, unless it's something like jumping between buildings, doing parkour, or something, most of the time, you're not going to injure or harm yourself. There's more room for iteration than there is with a pill or a potion. Although, certainly, pharmacology has its place. So you've had creative works certainly within the realm of music, also comedy, and producing film, and other things. For somebody out there who, of whatever age, maybe they're creating, maybe they know they have this creative antennae, the sources outside. What was it that Strummer said? I actually wrote this on the wall of my laboratory. No input no output. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That Strummer's law. It's written in my laboratory. The people in my lab were like, what's going on here? I think one guy knew what that was, but it was a picture of him, and picture of my bull dog, and no input no output. I don't think I can just stay in a room with four walls, and a ceiling, and nothing else and create. I mean, I know that there are certain number of things in here, but I do think accessing the world is important. RICK RUBIN: And the world is giving us clues all the time. If we're paying attention, that's another part of it. If you're paying attention, the thing that you are looking for is being either whispered or screamed at you in the outside world if you're paying attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I forget the exact title of the chapter, but there's a chapter about staying open to clues or being on the lookout for clues. Now, I feel tempted to look for the exact title of that chapter. RICK RUBIN: It's probably look for clues is what I guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look for clues sounds like it sounds right. And since you wrote it, I'm guessing that's right. RICK RUBIN: Well it's something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So do you think there are clues in everywhere? RICK RUBIN: Yes, I think there are clues everywhere. If we pay attention, we'll hear a phrase. It'll trigger a thought. We'll see something unexpected. If someone recommends something to you, maybe it's a coincidence. If three people recommend the same thing to you maybe it's not, who knows? Who knows? I do believe the universe is on the side of creativity. And the universe is supporting things to happen. And they can happen through you or they could happen through someone else. So if you're paying attention, maybe it'll happen through you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We had a guest on the podcast named Justin Sonnenburg. He's an expert in the gut microbiome. And he applied something that-- without knowing, he applied the opposite principle, the opposite is true principle. We were talking about these trillions of gut microbiota that clearly are doing amazing things to create, neurotransmitters, and govern our brain, and even decision making, how much sugar is in our system driving appetite, et cetera. And he said, we think of them as cargo, but maybe we're just vehicles and they're in charge. That all of our interactions like every time we shake hands or touch our eyes, we're exchanging gut microbiota. And we think of intelligence as thinking and intelligence. And he's a microbiologist. And in all seriousness he said, maybe we're the ones being manipulated. We're the house cats. And we think here we are, we're falling in love, and kissing, and shaking hands, and washing hands, and doing all sorts of things to isolate or connect with one another. And maybe the gut microbiota are really trying to optimize their survival. RICK RUBIN: That's what Laird Hamilton said that at one point in the sauna-- that when you're in the sauna, it's really hot. The feeling that you have of wanting to get out could be the bad critters in your body that can't handle it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like let's get out of here. RICK RUBIN: Are trying to convince you, from the inside, to get out. Maybe that's where the feeling of being compelled to get out comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So Elon getting us all to Mars might be a bit of-- maybe they just want to get to Mars. And so they're RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because I'm starting to feel like I'm channeling Lex Freedman here for a moment. No, I think this considering the opposite is really key. And while it might sound mystical to people or a little bit like we're just playing with ideas, that's exactly what you do in science. Someone walks in with a result and says, I found this. This is true. And you say, but what if it's all something else? A good example might be-- here I'm pulling from podcast episodes that we've had. But Alia Crum is this amazing psychologist who works on belief effects. Your knowledge strongly shapes the physiological outcome. And she had this amazing graduate thesis where she said, what if all of exercise is placebo, all of it? Yeah, burn some calories and does some things. Turns out this isn't the case. But it turns out a lot of the effects of exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure, relieving stress, positive are placebo but nobody thinks of it like that because we're so attached to calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: I think that's a big point that the belief part of it is a huge part of the conversation about everything. What we believe has power. If we believe we can make something great, the chances of us making something great are better than if we don't believe we can. So I would say, any ability to harness your belief on your behalf is a really healthy thing to do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And one thing that you make very clear is that while our own abilities may come into question from time to time, you absolutely believe that the elements from which to create are out there. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. All the elements are here. Everything is here. We get to pick and choose. We get to-- the conveyor belts going by with the little gifts. And we can-- first, we have to notice there's a conveyor belt. Then we notice the gifts. And then that's the starting point. And then we may even feel empowered enough to grab one of the gifts, and open it up, and see what's inside. And then maybe that started something really beautiful that we wouldn't have done. Everything that I make or have made has always been based on something that I see or hear that allows me to see something that I didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I was going to ask you whether or not, it's important to be happy in order to create, but certainly a lot of people that were unhappy were still able to create. But the more I listen to you, it seems that it's really about an ability to pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I'm unhappy or if I'm happy may not be as relevant as whether or not I'm able to stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. I would say that's-- I would say being able to stay present in the work is probably the most important part of it. And how you feel is less of an issue unless how you feel gets in the way of you feeling how the work makes you feel. Do you know what I'm saying? If you're in a lot of pain and you're looking at a piece of art, it may be hard to know how that art makes you feel because you're-- the big signal in your body is the physical pain. I'm sure there are some people who can do that too, who can, even through the physical pain, can feel it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, there's this idea of transmutation, of taking one emotion and contorting it and co-opting it into another action in an adaptive way. But this idea of distraction being a problem, this really resonates, I think. When I think of times of great productivity is when I was able to be undistracted. I could also see how success can be its own distraction. This is often discussed in the context of fighting sports, where someone starts making a lot of money and pretty soon their focus becomes all the things they can access with their success as opposed to the thing that got them there in the first place. Keeping an underdog mentality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we conclude, I do want to ask you about one other aspect of process, which is meditation. Meditation is interesting to me because when we close our eyes as most meditations are done and we focus on our brain, our brain has no sensation. Like if we-- RICK RUBIN: I wouldn't say we focus on our brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or we focus on something other than our normal experience, is that-- how would you define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, there's different-- there are different types of meditation. Either way, I would say there is no form of meditation where we're focused on our brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. I'm glad we disagree. RICK RUBIN: I would say, here are the things that happen. We either are engaging in a mantra, which would be a version of almost creating a trance for ourselves, not unlike listening to something when we go to sleep that would distract our conscious mind from participating. We would be overriding the talking mind with just a sound that we're generating, or a word, or phrase, a series of phrases. Meta meditation is a loving kindness meditation with phrases, could be that or it could be focused on the breath. But the purpose of being focused on the breath is to not hear the self-talk that we normally have. It's a single pointed focus exercise in those that I described. The other version is an awareness meditation, where you're closing your eyes. And you're being with whatever is and noticing-- so if we were to do it now, and you could do it eyes open or eyes closed with an awareness practice. But the first thing that I would do is I would feel-- I feel a little ringing in my ears. It might be from the electronic equipment around us. And I don't mean that I hear the sound. It's like a vibration. I hear cars passing in the distance. Let's see what else comes out, I can feel a feeling in my chest. I can feel this part of my face. I'm not sure why. It feels like it's related to my jaw. More car sounds. I'm aware of a little feeling of warmth. So now, I would say the room feels a bit warm. I wasn't aware of that before, when I wasn't just being with what's happening. I feel a little itch on my left shoulder. So that would be an awareness practice, which is another kind of meditation where you're just paying attention to what's going on. There's no story. There's no this means this. None of those things. It's like an inventory, almost, of everything that comes up when it comes up. And you do that for a period of time. But in all of those cases, in the example of doing the awareness meditation, or doing a mantra meditation, or focusing on the breath, in none of them am I thinking. And none of them am I concentrating on-- I'm being aware of sense perceptions in the awareness one or in the other meditations. I'm doing a practice so that I'm not aware of thinking about anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When did you start meditating and how often do you meditate now? RICK RUBIN: I learned when I was 14. And I started with TM. And that's probably the meditation that I've done the most in my life and I come back to. Although I tried many different kinds and also different physical forms of meditation-- Tai Chi, things like that. I meditated for five or six years. And then I stopped when I went to school, to university. And then I started again several years later. And when I started again, I realized how profound it wasn't in me that I had done it when I did it So I usually have some sort of a practice. In some ways, the beach walks could be a form of meditation. But for me, typically, I would wake up. It'd be the first thing I would do during that in-between time, maybe go out in the sun, close my eyes, and meditate before starting my day. If I'm doing it twice a day, the second time would probably be right before dinner if I'm doing it on a regular schedule. Then if I find myself on an airplane, I might meditate for an hour. I can remember, one time, meditating the entire flight from New York to LA, just was a great opportunity to do a deep dive. And time passes. You lose track of time. You don't even know-- it's like going to sleep and waking up. You don't feel like that was eight hours. It's just time stops. Not always, but when it does, it's a great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, you've sent me some meditations including the one that you did on that transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. And I've been trying to get-- do longer and longer meditations, but I've always meditated a little bit. But your meditation practice is one that I'm starting to adopt, maybe we could convince you to give us a suggestions of one or two and we can link out to them for listeners. I'm sure they'd appreciate. RICK RUBIN: And there's also meditation like practices to do that involve-- there's something called the surgical series from the Monroe Institute which I used when I had a surgery. You listen to this recording. And it both allows your body to heal much faster and remove some of the trauma that goes on when getting cut open-- it's traumatic. But just through listening to certain things, you can have a really powerful effect, heal much faster. I remember I was about to be put under for a surgery. And my eyes were closed. And I wasn't communicating with anyone there because I was going inside. And my wife was with me. And they came in. And they said, oh, so they already gave Rick the sedative because he's ready to go in. I don't think you gave him anything. He's like, look at his numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. Yeah, it's an amazingly powerful practice that I like because anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely, absolutely. And there's no good or bad version. It really is just-- if you learn a technique and show up and do it, it works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I love that you're so willing to share what you do in your process. Listen, I just want to say thank you for a number of things. I want to thank you for the music you've created and that you are to create because we want to be still ongoing, certainly for your time today in sharing your thought process and a bit of what goes into this incredible creative process. And I want to thank you for writing the book. I don't talk about or feature many books on the podcast. It's just not something we typically do, but I've seen a little bit of the evolution of it. And then I've seen it now and read through it in its final form twice, as I mentioned. And I'm going to continue to read through it again. It is one of those books where it is so filled with gems, like every chapter. I could take notes on this. And take notes on this. And it's assembled in a very digestible way that allows people to extract the meaningful parts in every chapter. And there are so many in a way that's very straightforward. So I love the book. So thank you for doing it because you certainly didn't have to write a book. But I'm so happy that you did. And I know that I've already benefited I know so many people are going to benefit. It's an amazing book. And I couldn't help but put my neuroscience lens on it. But I also, about halfway through, I learned to discard my pre-existing lens a bit and start to see things through what I think is a different perspective. So I just want to thank you for being such an incredible portal and also for being an amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you. I love you. I'm so happy to be here with you. And any time I get to see you, it's a good day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Likewise. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Rick Rubin-- all about creativity and the creative process. Please also be sure to check out his new book, The Creative Act-- A Way of Being by Rick Rubin. As I mentioned earlier, it's an incredible book and such a wealth of knowledge for you creative types out there, for those of you that seek to be more creative, or to understand the creative process generally. And as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode, Rick has very generously offered to answer your questions about creativity. So if you have questions for Rick Rubin about creativity, or the creative process, or anything else for that matter, please put those in the comment section on YouTube by writing in capital letters, QUESTION FOR RICK RUBIN. And then please put the question in there. That will make it easier for me to find those questions. I will record the conversation where I asked Rick, those questions. And of course, we will post his answers to those questions on our Huberman Lab clips channel. If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.

    "rawText": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing the immune system, and we are also discussing the nervous system, which is the brain, spinal cord, and the connections of the brain and spinal cord with all the organs of the body. We are also going to discuss how the nervous system can be used to activate and control the immune system. Now, about 10, 20 years ago, if somebody said that the mind could control the immune system, they'd probably get laughed out of most academic conferences. And certainly the work wouldn't be published in quality journals, but nowadays there are dozens, if not hundreds of quality peer-reviewed studies on how the mind and how the nervous system can control activation of the immune system. This is a wonderful growing body of research. And just to give you a hint of where we are headed with this, just this last week, there was a paper published in \"Nature\" which is the apex journal for scientific publishing, premiere journal, extremely stringent, a paper published in \"Nature\" from Qiufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School, explored how acupuncture can reduce inflammation in the body. And I will describe this study in a bit more detail later, but what they discovered was that by stimulating the body in particular ways at particular sites on the body, they were able to liberate certain cells and molecules that enhance the function of the immune system, and potentially can be used to combat different types of infection. And just to give you another little hint, they found that a particular type of organ tissue called fascia, some of you may have heard of fascia, fascia surrounds our muscles. Just to look at it, you might think it's a kind of useless tissue, it's sort of like a dense bag in which the muscles are contained. Well, it turns out that those dense bags are much smarter than we thought. They don't have a mind of their own, but by stimulating the fascia in a particular location on the body, there's a pathway leading out of that fascia directly to an organ called the adrenal medulla, I'll explain what all this means, that could liberate particular chemicals that had a potent anti-inflammatory effect. So what we're basically saying is that the nervous system acts as a set of highways between the different tissues of your body, calling into action the immune system, liberating particular molecules that can reduce inflammation and lead to faster healing. And I will explain how all of that works as well as some other non-acupuncture methods for activating and enhancing the function of the immune system. So, today, we're going to be talking all about healing with the mind in a completely non-mystical, non-abstract sense. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are absolute suburb quality. I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, and I can tell you that one of the major issues our visual system has to contend with is how to see things clearly in bright environments or dimmer environments, et cetera. ROKA clearly understands the science of the visual system, because one thing that's wonderful about their sunglasses is that you can be in a very bright environment and then walk into a shadowed environment and you don't even notice the transition. Everything is still seen with crystal clarity. Their eyeglasses as well allow you to see things regardless of how bright or dim internal lighting is. I wear readers at night, I wear sunglasses during the day, and ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses are particularly nice because they're very lightweight, so I often forget that they're even on my face. They also don't slip off if you get sweaty. They were actually designed to be used while running or cycling. And so I can use them while exercising. They also have a great aesthetic. So you can go from exercising, to dinner or to work, without having to change from one set of glasses to the next. If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code \"Huberman\" to save 20% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012. And so, I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice per day is because it allows me to cover all of my basic nutritional bases. It's got the vitamins and minerals that make sure that no matter what I'm eating, I'm covering all of my micronutrient bases. And it has the probiotics, and probiotics we now know are essential for a healthy gut microbiome. And a healthy gut microbiome we know is essential for many important biological functions related to human health, like metabolic needs, endocrine function, immune function, and so on. With Athletic Greens, I can mix that up with water. I usually add some lemon or lime juice. It tastes delicious. I like it very much and I'll drink it once early in the day, and once again later in the afternoon. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman. And if you do that, you can claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens, whether you're in the car, or on a plane, or on the move, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2. There is now a lot of data showing that vitamin D3 is important for many biological functions that impact our immediate and long-term health. And most people do not get enough vitamin D3, even if they're getting a lot of sunshine. And K2 is also important or has been shown to be important for heart health and for blood lipid function, et cetera. So, again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman to get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs, and the year supply of vitamin D3K2. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better meet your immediate and long-term health goals. I've long been a fan of getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the things that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. There's just simply no other body surface marker that you can look at somebody or yourself and say, \"Ah, I know that my blood lipids or my cholesterol are good, or that my hormone levels are X, Y, or Z.\" We really need numbers on those things to know where they sit. The problem with a lot of blood tests, however, is you get all those numbers back, you don't know what to do with that information. InsideTracker has solved that problem, and they have a very easy to use dashboard where when you get your numbers back, it can tell you for instance, where your numbers are high or low or on target. And they can suggest very specific dietary intervention, supplemental interventions, and behavioral interventions that can allow you to bring those numbers to where you would like them to be. So they've simplified the whole process. And in terms of getting the blood tests, you can go to a local center to get the blood drawn, or they can even send somebody to your house. So, they've made the whole thing very, very easy from start to finish. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit InsideTracker.com/Huberman to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. You just use the code \"Huberman\" at checkout. Okay, let's talk about the immune system, and the nervous system, and how the two interact, and how you can control your immune system to serve you better. We are going to talk a lot of mechanistic science, a little bit of detail, you'll learn some new language around the immune system; names of the different cell types and so forth, but I promised to make it all very clear, regardless of your background. We are also going to discuss a lot of tools. And I think many of you are probably here because you want to know what you can do in order to boost or enhance the function of your immune system. That's a very reasonable question to ask. I want to begin by just acknowledging that if one were to put that question into the internet, you would get back a lot of answers. And there is now a sort of generic form of that answer that deserves our respect, but is not going to be the topic of conversation today. I just want to tip my hat to it, however, and list off a few of the things that we know set us up to be healthier than we would be if we didn't do these things. So the first of course is the foundation of all mental and physical health, which is to get adequate sleep. Meaning enough sleep, whatever it is for you that you require, to get deep sleep, so it's got to be of high quality, and to time that sleep correctly. Meaning you can't sleep during the day one day, and at night the next day, and expect your system to function well. I've talked a lot about that before on this podcast. You need a relatively consistent sleep schedule most of the time, about 80% of the time, or even better would be 90% of the time. But the realities of life make it that we can't always go to bed at the same time and wake up at the exact same time. Okay, so we need sleep. We do need sunshine. Why do we need sunshine? Because it sets our rhythm into a regular state where the genes in all of our cells can be expressed at the correct times. We're sort of a factory of cells, if you will, and that factory can only run properly if it knows when certain things should be active and when certain cells should not be active. And the best way to coordinate all of those activities of all the cells is to get sunshine in your eyes in the morning and again in the evening, and not to get too much bright light in your eyes in the middle of the night. That's just foundational. And then any lists that you'll find on any number of websites on the internet would say, \"Okay, get good sleep, get sun, get exercise.\" How much exercise? We should all be getting 150 to 180 minutes of zone two cardio. That's cardiovascular exercise where we can just barely hold a conversation or maybe not, per week. We should be eating well. We're always told we have to get good nutrition. What good nutrition means to you is going to be different than what it means to somebody else. But we acknowledge that food intake and quality of food in particular, avoiding processed foods, that's going to be important. Social connection is important. Hydration is important. You're starting to get the picture. We can take all that, acknowledge it as useful and foundational for mental and physical health. But of course there are many people who still struggle with getting ill too often, or with not being able to heal from physical injuries and wounds, or from various bacterial and viral infections quickly enough or deal with chronic disease. And so, today's really about how you can take all of that information, acknowledge it, and follow it. But in addition to that, there are things that you can do to leverage your nervous system in order to enhance the function of your immune system in very robust ways. So that's where I'd like to shift the conversation to. The first topic we have to attack is the question of what is the immune system and how does it work? I think many of you have heard of antibodies or killer cells or the various organs of the body that are involved in the immune system, like the bone marrow, the spleen, the thymus, and the lymph nodes. I'd like to just take a moment and do a sort of brief immune system 101; really simple, cover the basic elements of the immune system so that everyone listening or watching this can get a clear sense of how the immune system functions and what its basic parts are. For some of you, this might be too basic. It might be a little bit of background that you already know. I think for most of you, this information will be new. And I promise you, you don't need a biology or medicine background in order to understand this. It's actually really simple because it is truly elegant in design. You have three main layers of defense for your health. These are the three things that are constantly at work to protect you from invasion and illness from bacteria, from viruses, and from parasites. And the first of those three is a physical barrier that we call your skin. And that might seem kind of obvious, but everything about you is contained in this compartment that is boundaried by your skin. And your skin is a very important aspect of your immune system. If you've ever had a cut, you essentially have a breach of the boundary that is your immune system, and you would notice a number of things would happen. You might get some swelling around that cut. You might get a scab, likely you would get a scab over time. If it got dirty, there were some bacteria that got in there, you might see some accumulation of white blood cells, what's called puss. I know it's kind of gross, but that's what that is. It might take on a yellow tint because of the accumulation of some dead cells there. But basically your skin is the primary barrier through which you keep things from the outside that could harm you from getting to the inside. Now, still in category one, your body and your external surface, you have openings to that surface, right? You're not just a round or a body shaped completely covered up with skin. You have openings, what are those openings? Well, let's start at the top and work our way down. A primary site of potential infection are your eyes. You have your ears, you have your nostrils, you have your mouth. Okay, those are going to be the primary sites by which things can get into your system. And you need to put things into your system; you need to drink and eat, and you need to get light into your system. That's why you have those openings, but bad things, meaning things that can harm you, can get into those systems. And then of course, along the back of your throat, all the way down to your stomach and your digestive system, and through your intestines and out your rectum, you have a tube, that you are basically a series of tubes. I've said that before on this podcast, and this is one such tube by which you extract nutrients from the outside environment. But all along that tube, including your nose and your mouth, it's lined with mucus. And while mucus might seem kind of gross to some of you, the more you learn about mucus, the more you realize that mucus is really, really cool because mucus essentially acts as a filter, as a trap for bacteria and viruses. And it has certain ways of scrubbing or killing those bacteria and viruses. Now, the mucus is constantly being turned over, as we'll talk about later, the chemistry of that mucus is really important in order to make sure that certain things don't make it into your system, and other things are allowed to move through your system and you can extract nutrients from them. So the reason I'm talking about this first category of barrier for immune system in such detail is I'd like you to envision yourself as a human, of course, but as a human that is a clear entity from everything else. And you have to bring in the right things and you have to keep out the wrong things or kill them. Now, inevitably, bacteria, viruses, and parasitic infections are going to make their way into our body, but whether or not they are killed off or whether or not they take over and cause us harm is going to be determined by layers two and three. So, layers two and three are the so-called innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. So the innate immune system is what I would call the second layer of defense. It's very fast. So whether or not it's bacteria, virus, or parasite, what happens when you have something enter your body, maybe you swallowed it, maybe got in through your eyes, maybe you shook somebody's hand who is carrying a particular kind of illness, and then you wiped your eyes. And I've talked about on this podcast before, very soon after we meet another person, usually within 30 seconds, believe it or not, most people wipe that person's chemicals somewhere on their face or on their body's surface. This has been demonstrated over and over again. If you want to learn more about that, we did an episode all about chemical signaling, where you can learn about it. I know it sounds weird and you might say, \"I don't do that,\" but indeed you do, most of the time most everybody does. Okay, so, this innate immune system is this rapid response when something enters our system and our body doesn't recognize it. It's not food, it's not clean air, it's something that's either a bacteria, virus or parasite. And the innate immune system involves the release of particular cells that are waiting dormant, ready to attack whatever this invader is. And some of these cell types you've heard of before. The most typical one are the so-called white blood cells. So, the white blood cells will actively go to the site of invasion and will start to encapsulate or try and surround that given invader. The other names of these different cell types are things like neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells are just a few of the many types of immune cells. So there's kind of like an ambulance system, but rather than go and try and heal something like a paramedic would, they go there and they try and surround and kill whatever this invader is. They work in concert with two other assistants, and those assistants are called the compliment proteins. Compliment proteins exist in the blood, and what they do is they travel to sites where there's an invasion and they mark certain things for being engulfed and eaten. So they sort of put an \"eat me\" tag on it. They basically put a chemical tag onto invaders that then allows those white blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells to say, \"Ah, I need to basically kill this thing, and then wrap it in a body bag and send it off. Kill that thing, wrap in a body bag and send it off.\" And I'm using the analogy of the body bag, but in the sense it's the right one rather because these cells that come in and kill things, the way they do that is actually to engulf the invading bacteria, virus or parasite. So they actually surround it. And when you see puss or you see infection in maybe a cut on the skin or something like that, or even in an ingrown hair that gets some bacteria in it, that puss and the white part, I know it's kind of gross to talk about, but those are the white blood cells, oftentimes it's dead cells, and that's the dead invader sitting there. So it's trying to create an isolated compartment 'cause it wants to keep it in that part of the body. Okay, so you've got the innate immune system, the compliment comes through blood and helps it by tagging certain things with an \"eat me\" signal. And then there are the cells that are either damaged from the injury or from the parasite, or are suffering because of the bacteria or the virus itself, and the cells of your body will also release an alarm signal, which is not an \"eat me\" signal, but a \"help me\" signal. And those \"help me\" signals come in the form of what we call cytokines. And the cytokines are things like interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. You may have heard of these things if you are at all curious about or have been learning about the health space, online health space, especially in the last few years, inflammation is all the buzz word now. Everyone's talking about inflammation, inflammation, inflammation. What do we mean when we say inflammation? Well, inflammation is a physical response, but it's also a chemical response. And many times the markers of inflammation that are measured in people or in animal models where this research is done, are things like interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha. So when those go up in the blood, it's a sign that somewhere there's a cell that's saying \"help me, help me.\" And is secreting these things which calls in those neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, and white blood cells, okay? And it might help to remember all this, by just telling people that what interleukin means is to communicate, right? So the interleukin is shouting out \"help me,\" the compliment proteins are coming in and saying, \"eat this\" and tagging the invader with an \"eat me\" signal. And then the killer cells and the white blood cells are doing the job of trying to kill off that thing. That's the innate immune system. So, your skin and your mucus lining plus your innate immune system are a beautiful two-layered set of defenses against various kinds of invaders and infections. And then there's the third type, which is the adaptive immune system. And you'll notice that leading up until now, I haven't said the word antibody at all, and that's because it is the job not of the skin or the mucus or the microbiome or the innate immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize specific invaders, but rather it is the job of the adaptive immune system to create antibodies against bacteria, viruses, and even parasites and even physical intruders to your system. So, the adaptive immune system has this incredible ability to show up at the site of invasion or infection or inflammation. It's called there by various cues, including the cytokines that we talked about earlier. And what it does is it actually attaches to and creates a sort of an imprint of the shape of whatever invader happens to be there. So if that particular invading bacteria or virus has a contour that's kind of rippled or kind of spiky or whatever shape it happens to have, it creates an imprint of that. And then, using that imprint in concert with some other cells, creates antibodies that are specific to recognize that invader should the body ever have that invader inside of it again. Now, that's why it's called the adaptive immune system. And in many ways it creates a memory of a prior infection so that these antibodies can be made anytime that same invader comes back again, all right? And so, this is the basis of what we call immunity. This is the basis of what we call an enhanced ability to combat certain types of infections. And it's really a wonderful, and I mean, I can't even state how incredible this really is, that all of our bodies have this capacity, right? We have something called leukocytes. These are essentially white blood cells. We have red blood cells and white blood cells, and they both are derived from the same type of origin cell. It's a stem cell. When you hear stem cell, a stem cell just means a cell that can become many different types of other cells. We sometimes hear about stem cells in terms of people that are getting injections of stem cells or the potential therapeutic effects or potential of stem cells. But we all harbor certain stem cells within us as well, that can become lots of different cell types. And there's one particular type of stem cell, which is the hematopoietic stem cell, which can give rise to red blood cells and white blood cells. And in general, these reside in the marrow, at least in adults. So, in our bone marrow, we have this ability to make certain cells that can go out when they are called out chemically, they get called out to sites of infection and create antibodies, and then maintain those antibodies in our system, or have a memory of that particular infection so that if the infection comes back again, we can kill it off immediately. And it doesn't have to pass through these multiple stages of first, the innate response, then the adaptive response, taking some time. Now, there are a lot more details to the adaptive immune system, but I just want to emphasize a few points that might be relevant. First of all, the name of the antibodies that are created sometimes come in the form of IgM and IgG, things of that sort. This isn't a full deep dive immunology class, but Ig stands for immunoglobulin, okay? So the immunoglobulins are a part of the adaptive immune response in creating antibodies. If you hear IgM, the IgM is the first of the adaptive immune responses, and it tends to come on earlier. So if somebody is immunopositive for IgM for a particular type of viral or bacterial invader, that means that it was a fairly recent infection. Later, one creates... The adaptive immune system, I should say, creates an IgG, which is the more stable form of the specific antibody that's going to recognize a given invader. So IgG tends to come up a little bit later. So, just to recap, something gets into your system through your eyes, through some hole in your skin, a cut, through your mouth, sexually transmitted diseases come in through the mucus membranes that are on the genitalia or in the genitalia, sexually transmitted disease, airborne disease, gets into the mucus, somehow gets into the bloodstream. Then there's the innate response, which is a more general response of trying to contain and combat the infection or invader. And then the adaptive response is the one that generates the antibodies. First, the IgM response, the immunoglobulin-M response, and then the immunoglobulin-G response, IgG response. So, how do we keep these three barriers or these three defense systems to infection tuned up? Well, leaving aside the list of things that I mentioned before that generally enhances their function, things like sleep and sunlight and good nutrition, et cetera, the sort of generic things for good health, one of the key ways we can do that is to keep that mucus lining in really good shape. And what does that mean? Well, the mucus lining needs to turn over quite often and it needs to be the correct chemistry to be a trap for the bad stuff and for it to be permeable to the good stuff, to the nutrients that we need. And it is now very clear from hundreds, if not thousands of studies that the best way to do that is to maintain a healthy so-called microbiome. The microbiome being these little bacterial organisms that are good for us that live all along our mucus pathways and even in our eyes. Now, just to be really clear, it's not just about the gut microbiome; we actually have a microbiome in our eyes, we have one that's specific to our mouth, we have a nasal specific microbiome, there's one all along the gut and the species of microbiota that live all along the digestive tract differ from the mouth, to the throat, to the stomach, intestines, into the rectum. It's well-established that there are healthy microbiota that live all along that length, and that they differ along that length. There's also a urethral microbiota, and there's a vaginal microbiota that promotes health of that environment as well. So how is it that one can maintain the healthy microbiota and not favor growth of harmful bacteria, or allow that mucus lining to become too permeable to the bad stuff that can come in from the environment? Well, as far as we know, there are three main ways to do that. The first two are purely structural and mechanical. It's very clear now from work, some of which was done at Stanford, but elsewhere as well, that the nasal microbiome is particularly good at scrubbing bacteria, at preventing certain types of infections. So, this is a reminder that whenever possible, unless eating or speaking, you want to be nasal breathing, not breathing through your mouth. Your nose is a much better filter for viruses and bacteria than is your mouth. The mouth contains certain structural features, even organs and cell types that can protect against incoming infection, but you don't want to be a mouth breather for a variety of reasons. And there's a terrific book called \"Jaws: A Hidden Epidemic,\" which was written by my colleagues, Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford, and Stanford Medicine with a foreword by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky. So it's really a lot of heavy hitters on that book that talks about the increase in infection that one gets when breathing through the mouth, as opposed to the nose. Now, of course, during hard exercise, one breathes through the mouth, that's not necessarily bad. When one is eating or speaking, that's not necessarily bad at all. I guess it depends on what you're saying. That was a joke. But in general, when possible you want to be breathing through your nose. Many people have trouble breathing through their nose because of so-called deviated septums or chronically collapsed sinuses. The best way to dilate those sinuses is actually to breathe through your nose. So it can take a little bit of time, but there is some plasticity to the sinuses. And so, be a nose breather, not a mouth breather, you will combat more of the infections that you are constantly confronted with. I should mention that we are always bombarded with different types of bacteria, viruses, and parasites in our environment. And the goal of course, is to reinforce your immune system, so you can keep these things at bay and not get sick. There's actually a paper that was published in Cell Reports, \"Cell Press Journal,\" excellent journal that showed that the nasal microbiome, it has particular species of microbiota that are good at fighting off infection. There has not been a direct link between particular patterns of nasal breathing and the nasal microbiome yet, but oxygenation of that environment by breathing through your nose, turns out to be quite important overall for enhancing it as a filter. So don't just think of your nose as something to smell foods and to bring in air. It's also an active filter for things that could invade you. The other way to try and keep out bad things and to avoid getting sick is the advice that your mother, and certainly my mother gave me, which is to not touch your eyes after touching other people or touching other surfaces. And as I mentioned earlier, we tend to do this subconsciously. But the reason to avoid doing that is the eyes are a primary entry point for a lot of bacteria and viruses. You're constantly lubricating the surface of your eyes with the so-called lacrimal glands, and tears and things of that sort. If you've ever noticed when you wake up in the morning, you have some sleep in your eyes, you know the kind of crusty stuff in the corners of your eyes or on your eyelashes, that sleep, that crust are actually dead bacteria that you've successfully battled during the night. Okay, that's what that is. It's not the accumulation of some healthy tissue. It's the accumulation of that your healthy mucus membranes and tears and other things that are specifically combating those bacteria. So, I know that sounds a little bit gross, but that's what that is. So you're wiping away the casualties of a battle that you fought at night. So during the daytime, you don't want to introduce viruses and things to your eyes as much as possible. It is a primary site of entry. This is why people wear goggles in surgical units and things of that sort, to try and avoid getting things into their eyes. Very, very important. And then the third way to keep a healthy line of defense for your entire mucus tract is to enhance the proliferation of good gut microbiota. The best way to enhance the quality of your gut microbiome and the mucus lining that serves as this protective layer all along your body is to ingest two to four servings a day of fermented foods, low sugar fermented foods. I've talked about this before a bunch of times on the podcast, but these are data from my colleague, Justin Sonnenburg's lab at Stanford Med. And there, I just wiped my eyes. Yep, you got me. But a paper published in the journal \"Cell,\" which is a absolutely spectacular journal, really points to the fact that when people eat fermented foods, two to four servings per day, it helps reduce the activity of certain cytokines. Now, you know what those are, right? Cells make cytokines to call out, \"help me, help me.\" To reduce the amount of cytokines, the so-called inflammatom. Now that doesn't render those cells more vulnerable. The reason they saw a reduction in IL-6 and IL-1, and some of these other cytokines is because when people have a healthy gut microbiome, there are fewer cells in the body being infected from outside infections and therefore less of a reason for cells to be crying out, \"help,\" because they are thriving, not suffering. So, don't wipe your eyes, keep your hands clean, everyone tells you that, right? But keep your hands clean, don't wipe your eyes, be a nasal breather, not a mouth breather, unless you're speaking, exercising or eating, and keep a healthy gut microbiome by eating two to four servings a day of quality, low sugar, fermented foods, things like sauerkraut, things like natto if you can access that. I've tried it before, it's interesting. It's sort of an acquired taste, kimchi, pickles, again, low sugar sources are going to be the sources that are going to be most effective for this. So now you're armed with three ways to enhance the function of your immune system and combat infection that is, I like to think separate from the typical type of information that you get such as get good sleep, good nutrition, good social connection, et cetera. All of that stuff still holds true, but these three other points I think can really make a substantial difference in terms of bolstering the immune system, your immune system. I do want to mention, because these names are going to come up several times during this episode, that while interleukins like IL-6 and IL-1 encourage inflammation, they are these \"help me\" signals that call in cells to gobble up invaders. There are some interleukins that are anti-inflammatory. And the one that I'd like to highlight in particular, because it will come up again in a little bit is interleukin-10. So not all of the IL, insert number, not all of the interleukins are inflammatory, some are anti-inflammatory. So that's an important point to keep in mind as we go forward. Next, I'd like to talk about what's called sickness behavior. And indeed there is a category of behavior that we call sickness behavior that is very informative as to the things that we can do to avoid getting sick. Now, this notion of sickness behavior goes back several decades or more. And it's a very interesting way of looking at the function of the immune system, because what it does is it bridges us from this thing that we're calling the immune system where it's T-cells, and B-cells, and cytokines and leukocytes, and it starts taking us into the realm of the nervous system, because of course the nervous system controls behavior. So sickness behavior is a suite of responses that we tend to all undergo when we are feeling sick. So this is going to vary from person to person, but there's some general categories of things that we all do and that happen to all of us after we are wounded or sick or dealing with an infection of any kind. And by examining sickness behavior in some detail, it can be really informative as to routes that we can take to health. So the main thing about sickness behavior is that it tends to involve a slowing of our usual levels of activity. People start to feel lethargic, or they feel like the activities that previously they could do with relative ease are very difficult for them or somewhat overwhelming. The other thing you start to see is that people and animals, by the way, stop grooming, they stop taking care of themselves. Not necessarily stopped showering, although oftentimes that's the case, but they will stop doing their hair, they'll stop putting on makeup, depending on whether or not they did that before, they might stop. Animals will stop licking and grooming themselves. People will stop taking care of their cosmetic appearance. Now it's not just because they don't care how they look when they're sick, it's because there's this overall suppression of certain kinds of activities and an enhancement of other kinds of activities. And this is really important. Sickness behavior is actually a motivated state. It's a state that's designed to accomplish certain things. One of the other features of sickness behavior in addition to being lethargic, loss of grooming, will be a loss of appetite, right? Oftentimes people who have a great appetite normally just won't feel hungry at all. And there are several theories as to why this would be. One prominent idea in the literature is that it's to discourage vomiting and diarrhea, which of course can be infectious to other people. So, that's a theory. I don't know that that's ever been tested directly, but that's one idea. The other idea is that it's simply to harbor more resources for sake of repair. And I want to talk about that because we are all told to get extra sleep when we aren't feeling well or to rest. But just like any good two or three-year-old constantly asks, \"why, why?\" Good scientists, good people who are interested in health information should always be asking why. Why should I get more sleep? What happens in sleep that I should get more sleep when I'm sick? Why shouldn't I just push through this? And there are a couple of reasons for this that have been established in the literature. The first is that there does seem to be something useful about slowing circulation when we are ill. One idea that has some data to support it is that when we slow our circulation, our blood circulation, so not running around so much or running it all, but rather lying down, getting extra rest, maybe sleeping, maybe even just remaining still, is that the lymphatic system, which carries a lot of the immune-related cells and fluids, is able to ramp up its levels of activity. So, this is interesting, right? So reducing circulation of the blood, but increasing circulation of the lymphatic system. You've all probably been familiar with the lymphatic system when you're combating an infection, your lymph nodes can get sore. You've got lymph nodes behind your ears, in your groin, your armpits, around your throat, around near your thyroid, in your throat, et cetera. So, that's the other reason. Now, some people, when they get sick, psychologically go into a very vulnerable state where they really, really want people, other people to take care of them. You've probably witnessed this, or you feel this way yourself. About 50% of people have that response. They really want to be taken care of. Now, when you think about it from an adaptive perspective, this makes sense, right? A member of our species is ill and they more or less will cry out for help in one form or another to the other members of their species to take care of them. And of course this will be especially apparent in cases where people are young enough or incapacitated enough that they can't actually get resources on their own. If you've ever been really sick, just getting up and going to the fridge or to the restroom can feel like a monumental task. So about 50% of people report or describe seeking of help and support when they are sick. But you could also imagine how this would be a very non-adaptive response because it increases the opportunity to spread infection to the caretaker. So that's an interesting consideration. Another 50% of people seem to have the opposite response when they're sick. So, somehow, regardless of how they were prior to getting ill, the sickness behavior that's engaged by these neural circuits in the brain, they are indeed neural circuits in the brain, create a stay away from me. I don't want to be bothered. I want to be left alone. I don't want to be taken care of, right? It's not stubbornness. It's literally a lack of interest or a disinterest in social connection when one is sick. And you see this in animals too, some animals will seek out other members of their species. Others, like my unfortunately now passed away bulldog, Costello. When he was sick I always knew because he would go around the back of the house and he would just hide there. He would just take himself away from everybody else. He did not want to be taken care of. And it was just a natural response to him. I don't think he was trying to prevent me from getting whatever it was that he had. So if ever somebody doesn't want to be taken care of, or if they do want to be taken care of, realize that people tend to fall into these two bins naturally, and animals tend to fall into these bins. Regardless of what species they are, it's about 50/50. And again, this sickness behavior is a motivated state. It's designed to slow circulation of the blood, increase circulation of the lymph, and the other killer cells in the body, reduce the probability of infecting others by reducing, its thought, diarrhea and vomit, but also breathing on others, interacting with others. And in some cases it will activate this, I don't want to call it a regressed state, but many people feel somewhat more... If they are adults, they feel more childlike when they are ill and they want to be taken care of very badly. Some of it might be learned. Some of it might be innate. We don't know, but the sickness behavior is very interesting for a couple of reasons. First of all, it mimics another state that has been described in the neuroscience literature, which is major depression. And in both sick individuals, sick from bacterial or viral infection, and in people with major depression, it's been shown that there are robust increases in the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. So there is an idea now circulating that depression involves these inflammatory cytokines being very active. And we know that illness involves inflammatory cytokines being very active. So if you think about it, the similarity between major depression and being sick ought to be able to point us in a direction of interventions that could help us either prevent illness or move through illness more quickly. But as we head in that direction, because indeed that's the case, I just want to emphasize that sickness behavior is what provides this bridge between the immune system and the nervous system. And what we'll soon see also is that healthy behavior, behavior that allows us to avoid infection, also points to a clear bridge between the nervous system and the immune system. That it isn't just that we have a brain and body and our organs, and then we have an immune system. That's true, but they're interacting all the time. And this is going to lead us to a place where it's going to be very clear and not at all surprising how certain patterns of thinking and certain behaviors that we can elect to take can help enhance our immune system function and vice versa. There are two other features of sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out. One is a theory, which is that the reduced appetite, in particular appetite for protein rich foods when sick, is thought to be an attempt, a subconscious attempt, of the organism to reduce the amount of iron that it's taking in. Now, typically the amount of iron intake that's recommended or more or less is for men, it's about eight milligrams per day. For women, it's anywhere from 18 to 27 milligrams per day, depending on whether or not they're pregnant, lactating or menstruating, et cetera, the ranges can vary. But, and indeed, it's true that if iron levels in the blood go too high, like over 45 milligrams per day can be very toxic to the system. But the theory that's prominent in the biology literature and in the health literature is that the reduction in appetite is actually an attempt to reduce iron intake specifically because many bacteria and other forms of infection seem to thrive when levels of iron in the blood are high. And I don't want to see anyone take this too extreme and suddenly do an iron deprivation diet in order to get well. But it's an interesting theory that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention, because it makes good sense. Iron is actually attached to hemoglobin and red blood cells in the bloodstream. Normally that can help us quite a lot. It's also in muscle, I should mention that. Iron can be a sequestered into muscle, and iron serves a lot of important health promoting roles, but by reducing appetite and thereby reducing iron intake, it does reduce the capacity of certain things, including infections to travel in certain compartments within the body. So, again, that's just theory, but I think many of you are probably familiar with not having an appetite when you're sick. The other thing that's very typical of people with major depression is loss of appetite, not always but often loss of appetite. So, here again, we have loss of appetite in sickness behavior, loss of appetite and major depression, and perhaps not surprisingly one of the major symptoms of sickness behavior and major depression that map more or less onto one another is loss of libido or interest, not just in social interactions, but in sex and reproduction. And so, again, if you think about sickness behavior and depression, they are very, very similar. Okay, so sickness behavior and major depression have certain core features in common. We need to therefore ask ourselves why and how does being sick influence the way that we think and perceive our environment and impact our appetite, whether or not we want to be cared for more or cared for less? Again, people tend to diverge into two different bins there, and believe it or not, the pathway for this has been identified. When we have an infection someplace in our body, and it could be up in our head, it could be a sinus infection, it could be an ear infection, or I should also mention many of these same mechanisms can also be the consequence of a wound or an injury to the body. A back injury or a slipped disc or I guess it's called a herniated disc is the way that you hear it described. When we have that, we can be kind of irritable, we don't want to do certain things and we just want to be left alone. Things are harder. How? Why? Well, there's a known pathway, which is the so-called vagus nerve that connects the body and the brain, signals to particular brain sites to engage this category of motivational state that we call sickness behavior. Many of you have probably heard of the vagus, V-A-G-U-S, vagus. The vagus nerve is a very extensive nerve pathway, as the 10th cranial nerve comes out of the back of the brainstem, heads into the body, and branches out extensively to innervate or connect to many of our organs, including our lungs, our heart, our gut, et cetera. And all of those organs are able also to send neural signals back up to the brain. We sometimes hear of the vagus as the route to calming ourselves down. Unfortunately, that's more or less a myth that I don't know how it got propagated. You have lots of different pathways in the vagus Usually vagal stimulation actually creates more arousal and alertness, although it does have multiple pathways, but there have now been many studies of the vagus in various contexts, including in sickness behavior. And it's very clear that the vagus nerve is the fast pathway by which an infection in the body is signaled to the brain, to a particular location in the brain called the hypothalamus, which harbors a lot of different types of neurons. Neurons, for instance, in the preoptic area that increase body temperature and fever, right? That's one of the most important things is to increase body temperature, it's the body's attempt to kill off this invader because many viruses and many bacteria don't survive well at elevated heat. That's the function of a fever. A fever actually has a functional role. So, in biology, we like complicated words, so we call anything that increases body temperature or creates a fever, a pyrogen. Many years ago, in my undergraduate years, I was working on pyrogens, injecting something called lipopolysaccharide into the belly, which then gives you a fever. The way it does that is LPS causes an inflammation response in the gut. The gut doesn't know what is happening. The stomach cells don't know what's happening. So they just start secreting the IL-6, the IL-1, all those cytokines, the killer cells migrate into the gut. That's why you sometimes get a stomach ache when you don't feel well, you have a flu, or something like it. A neural signal, electrical signals get sent up to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus says, oh, I don't know what's going on out there, but there's a signal something's going on. Let's just heat up the body. Let's just start cooking whatever it is out there. And of course you don't want fever to go too high because you can kill brain cells. But within a particular range the fever is a functional and adaptive response, okay? So if you're taking drugs to try and lower the fever that might make you feel more comfortable, but actually that's limiting the response that your body is creating in order to try and kill off that invader. And again, you don't want fever to go too high. This is going to vary depending on age. You can look up online what the tolerable ranges are for fever. But when you're trying to lower body temperature when you have a fever, unless you're heading into dangerous levels of heating up, that's actually the wrong way to take your system if you do indeed want to kill off that invader. Okay, so the vagus nerve is the quick response. It also sends input to areas of the brain that change your perception of the outside world. One of the most obvious of these, obvious once I tell it to you, is photophobia, right? I love bright sunshine. I love bright lights when I want to be alert. We all have different levels of light sensitivity, but most people when they are sick, when there's an inflammation response in the body, they feel like bright lights are kind of aversive. They get a well-described kind of classical photophobia, and that's mediated by a pathway that goes from your eye to an area of your thalamus, called the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This is work that was done by Clifford Saper at Harvard Medical School. It's really beautiful work. And then from there up to the outer lining of the brain, which is the meninges just sort of on the outside of the brain where the brain starts to interface with some of the other connective tissues. We'll talk more about these later. It can actually create a photophobia and a headache when one is ill. So, here's the pathway: Some invader gets into your system 'cause you wiped your eyes or it got in through your mouth. You didn't listen to your mother and got in through your eyes. You're feeling sick. Something's going on there. You have a stomach ache because of all the inflammation there, the signal goes up from your vagus nerve. You're heating up with a fever. You've got photophobia because you've activated this pathway by which what would normally be tolerable light is triggering this thalamic nucleus, the anterior thalamus, that's projecting up to the meninges. You got a headache in response to looking at light. It's basically triggering an overall pathway to get you to go into a quiet, dark place and rest. And the last element I'd like to talk about is the rest. There's something that gets triggered from the body to the brain, to the hypothalamus, and we think we know which hypothalamic area it is. It's the supraoptic nucleus, we think. Supraoptic 'cause it's right above your so-called optic chiasm, If you want to look up where that is, it's right above the roof of your mouth. And there are nuclei there that promote the desire to sleep even during the daytime, what would normally be the active phase of your circadian cycle. Now, that is really interesting because what's happening here is you've got multiple pathways that are saying avoid light, reduce your amount of behavior, heat up, all the things that are making you sick. This is sickness behavior, and it's going from your body to your mind to make you do the right thing. Now there's also a slow pathway that's purely mediated by the blood, so-called humoral factors. Not 'cause they're funny, but humoral factors are factors of the blood. As you have an infection for many hours or days, the amount of IL-6 and IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor and other inflammatory cytokines is starting to increase such that the total amount in your circulation gets high enough and is communicated to the brain. And it tends to enter the brain through a particular type of tissue that's really interesting called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D. Choroid is really interesting. It's kind of this fluffy tissue that sits in your ventricles. The ventricles are the spaces in your brain, and the spaces in your brain have what's called cerebral spinal fluid in them. The cerebral spinal fluid contains a number of important things, but the choroid starts releasing and responding to these cytokines, the inflammatory cytokines, and then the brain actually starts to experience all sorts of changes in terms of inflammation to neurons, your memory tends to get poor, your cognition tends to get poor. These are transient things most often. Eventually these things will pass, but this is deep into sickness when you're really feeling lousy. You can't read, you can't watch a movie, you can't do anything. So if you ever get sick and you just can't be bothered by anything, it's probably because you've had that fast response from the body and you've also had the slower response where you literally have a set of tissues in your brain that are sending out these inflammatory signals. And now your whole brain is starting to cope, or is trying to cope with this infection. So you've got a slow pathway and a fast pathway. That all sounds really terrible. So, now, I'd like to talk about what you can do to reduce the probability of getting sick. And there are actually things that one can do as you start to get sick and once you're sick, to accelerate the healing process by flipping the equation. Up until now we've been talking about how the body activates certain areas in the brain to create sickness behavior that's very much like depression. You're probably all familiar with this from anytime you've had a cold or a flu or something really lousy or an injury. Now, let's flip the equation and ask what can we do with our nervous system in order to enhance the function of our immune system in order to be able to heal and recover from illness and injury more quickly. So let's say you are in that unfortunate circumstance of waking up one day or coming home, and you've got that tickle in your throat, or when you breathe, your nasal passages don't feel the same way. You've got a little bit of a headache. You're feeling kind of off. We all know what we should do. We should all hydrate, drink some water and go to sleep. Right, that's we are all told, but there are actually things that you can actively do in order to get your immune system to deploy a more robust response at that early phase of potential infection. Let's focus first on the rest component. Yes, of course we are all told that we should take a hot shower and go to sleep, and get nine or 10 hours of sleep. But there's an interesting way of looking at sleep, specifically for its role in enhancing the immune system. And there's a wonderful review, I'll put the review in the captions that looked specifically at the literature surrounding sleep that is different because it occurs in support of the immune system. So normally when we go to sleep, we have slow-wave sleep predominantly in the early phase of the night, and then over time as we sleep longer and longer, we get more so-called REM, rapid eye movement sleep. I talked all about this on the episodes on sleep. Of course you have slow-wave sleep and REM sleep throughout the night always, but it's the fraction of slow-wave sleep to REM sleep that shifts, and they have different functions, et cetera. There is some evidence that the sleep associated with an infection, in particular, early stage of infection, is associated with elevated levels of serotonin in the brain that either through an adaptive mechanism or for whatever reason, the neurons in the brain of the so-called raphe nucleus start releasing more serotonin. And that serotonin and its related pathways can help enhance some of the immune system function that could combat the infection. There is starting to be some data, and I emphasize starting because it's not a very robust literature yet, looking at whether or not supplementing precursors to serotonin like 5-HTP, which can be taken in a supplement form or consuming foods that increase serotonin naturally. So these would be any foods that contain high levels of tryptophan. You can look up what those are. So, white meat turkey, for instance, certain complex carbohydrates can often be rich with tryptophan. That consuming those foods can enhance the amount of serotonin that's available in the brain and blood and thereby lead to the particular quality of sleep that allows for more deep healing or for when I say deep healing, I mean for a more robust immune response. Now, again, those are still emerging data. What is very clear, however, is that during sleep and in particular, during sleep that's associated with the early stage of any kind of viral or bacterial infection, the so-called glymphatic system is much more active than it would be normally. What's the glymphatic system? The glymphatic system is actually a relatively recent discovery. I mentioned lymph and the lymphatic system earlier, the glymphatic system with a G, is a system in the brain by which debris that accumulates throughout the day, but in particular, debris that accumulates under conditions of neuroinflammation and inflammation of the body, is cleared out or is washed out of the brain. And the activity of this glymphatic system is extremely important for the recovery from infection of any kind. And it's now becoming clear, is important for recovery from traumatic head injury, and maybe even from psychological trauma. So, the glymphatic system can be thought of more or less as a plumbing system that runs through the ventricles, but also mainly through the lining that sits between the brain and the skull and some of the other tissues and things of that sort. The choroid is involved as well. Brain imaging reveals the glymphatic system is very active during deep sleep. And there's this kind of wash out of the glymphatic system. And I am aware of some studies that are ongoing now where augmenting the serotonin system through either supplementation of tryptophan or 5-HTP or even serotonin itself, these are laboratory studies, is being looked at for its capacity to increase the amount of circulation in the glymphatic system. And the idea is that it might, and I want to underscore might, potentially lead to more rapid recovery from injury and illness and potentially ramp up, if you will, the activity of the immune system. So, it essentially is a ramping up of the activity of the immune system. Now, regardless of whether or not you decide to, for instance, supplement with 5-HTP before sleep or not, I'll talk about what that might look like in a moment, there is a way that you can increase the activity of your glymphatic system under normal circumstances. Because of the mechanics of the glymphatic system, it turns out that if you elevate your heels by about 12 degrees, it doesn't have to be exactly 12, as you sleep by putting maybe a rolled pillow or two pillows underneath your feet, by having the head below your legs. It seems that there's more glymphatic washout or clearance during sleep. And this is without taking any compound to adjust the serotonin system. So I would say if you're not feeling well, yes, take the hot shower. Yes, get into bed and go to sleep, but elevate your feet to try and increase the activity of the glymphatic system. Some might even consider that if you have to be awake, that you might want to be awake with your feet elevated above your head. Now that might not be practical for the workplace, but it might be practical for a short nap during the day or something of that sort. The glymphatic system is not just active during sleep. It's also active during certain phases of waking, in particular when we are in a deep state of relaxation. So as many of you probably know I'm a big proponent of self-hypnosis because of the quality scientific literature on this. If you're interested in self-hypnosis, you can go to Reverie, R-E-V-E-R-I.com. Reverie is a cost-free app for Apple and Android that was developed by my colleague, David Spiegel, and others at the Stanford University School of Medicine, based on quality studies and peer reviewed data, showing that deep states of relaxation can be used to improve pain management, improve transition time to sleep, and a number of other things. You can select the various sort of outcomes that you're seeking using Reverie. It's a great thing especially for people that are challenged with meditation could use, because you just listened to the script. It involves deep relaxation. I would suggest using that script, or the script for sleep, but with feet elevated to increase activity of the glymphatic system. Now, if you do decide that you want to test out this serotonin hypothesis on your own, obviously check with a doctor. I'm not a doctor, I'm a professor. So, I'm professing things, not suggesting things, but 5-HTP is a supplement that I've talked about before on this podcast that I actually do not recommend for most people for sake of sleep, because it can disrupt the normal architecture of sleep and create a deep sleep early in the night, and then a spontaneous waking with some trouble to get back to sleep. And that's because of the way that the serotonin system and the melatonin system interact. However, under conditions where one is feeling like they might have an infection or an early stage of illness, in that case, 5-HTP might be a useful supplement in order to access these states of sleep that are not typical. They're not the typical deep sleep that you would achieve when you're feeling healthy. These are states of sleep that are specifically there in order to try and repair some of the immune system related inflammation that's occurring. If you'd like to explore the 5-HTP approach and you feel it's right and safe for you, and you've talked to your doctor, it's 300 to 500 milligrams taken about 30 to 60 minutes before going to sleep for the night. That's the typical protocol. Not incidentally, increasing serotonin is also one typical approach for the treatment of major depression. This is the basis for things like SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like Prozac and Zoloft, and so forth. The 5-HTP approach is a much milder approach than prescription drug, of course, but will allow more serotonin to be synthesized and/or released. Now, for those of you that are interested in learning more about the glymphatic system, it's a fascinating system, and you might want to do a deep dive there in terms of the behavioral protocols, and what's known about it, there's a wonderful article called \"The Glymphatic System: A Beginner's Guide.\" This is a scientific article. The first author is Jessen is the last name, J-E-S-S-E-N. If you put in \"Jessen, The Glymphatic System: A Beginner's Guide,\" you can access the full length manuscript easily online. It'll show up immediately in your search. And in a really interesting way, the glymphatic system has now also been tied to the iron deposition system. Earlier we were talking about iron and how, of course, getting enough dietary iron is important, but if levels of iron are too high it isn't good for a number of reasons. There's a very interesting article that just came out last year called \"Dysfunction of the glymphatic system might be related to iron deposition in the normal aging brain.\" So, we're starting to see these links between iron levels being too high, the glymphatic system not being active enough and so forth, leading to sickness behavior, inflammation, and maybe even damage to neurons associated with aging. We can flip that on its head and say that increasing the activity of the glymphatic system, feet elevated during deep sleep, maybe even feet elevated above the head while awake, during a nap or doing a Reverie script once a day or something of that sort, could increase the activity of the glymphatic system, lowering iron to a point that's probably below the typical intake during periods of infection, perhaps, I should say, can enhance the glymphatic system and vice versa. And then you've got this specialized sleep that's related to sickness behavior that seems to have heightened levels of serotonin that might be augmented by ingesting 5-HTP. Again, not on a regular basis. I don't suggest that people take compounds that increase serotonin unless it's prescribed to you for depression or something, but not doing by supplement with tryptophan or 5-HTP on a regular basis, but only under conditions where as I mentioned, you might be starting to feel sick or you're coming down with something, or you're combating some sort of infection. So if we consider the advice that we typically get when we're not feeling well of take a hot shower, get into bed and go to sleep, and we've now touched on ways to potentially increase the efficacy of the sleep part through the glymphatic and the serotonin system. What about the take a hot shower part? Is that good advice? Well, it turns out it is, and there's actually a way to do even better. There's a study, a very interesting study, the title reveals where I'm going with this, it's \"Effect of a single Finnish sauna session on white blood cell profile and cortisol levels.\" In this case, it was done in athletes and non-athletes, which is kind of nice. This involves taking athletes and non-athletes and exposing them to sauna. It wasn't particularly hot. It was 96 degrees, which isn't cool, but it's not really hot. Nowadays you hear about people doing very, very hot sauna. The humidity of the sauna, if you want to know, is 15 plus or minus 3%. But basically what they found was that just one 15 minutes sauna session could really increase white blood cell profiles and could adjust cortisol levels in ways that were beneficial for combating infection. And now there are many other studies like this. Now, this should immediately make sense based on what we said before about fever; heating up can actually help combat infection. But for those of you that have listened to the episodes on temperature, what you probably know is that when you get into a sauna or any kind of hot environment, your body is also going to be actively pushing to cool itself off. So, there's probably an increase in heat, there is an increase in heating, but then afterwards your body will cool off, maybe even with a dip below baseline. I do want to provide a cautionary note that if you are already running a fever, getting into a sauna could take your body temperature into dangerously high levels, dangerously meaning you can kill neurons. And once you kill neurons, they do not come back. So, please don't kill your neurons. I don't recommend getting into a sauna if you're already running a fever. So this would be something to do at the initial stage of an infection or if you're feeling a little bit off. So this is kind of a ramping up or a super protocol of the typical advice of take a hot shower and get into bed. That is good advice. Now we're talking about a hot sauna, probably showering off and then getting into bed, maybe augmenting serotonin. I know many people don't have access to sauna. So, in that case, a very hot bath or shower, don't scald yourself, of course, but as hot as you can comfortably tolerate or right at that edge of what you can tolerate would be a good idea. Some people I've heard are creating saunas in their bathrooms by running hot water and creating a ton of steam. Anything that really heats you up, but not to dangerously high levels is going to be beneficial. If you have access to a sauna, terrific. This again was only 15 minutes. They'd had a cool off session. Would you get more of an increase? People always want to know if you did it twice as much, would you get twice an increase? Those data don't really exist yet. However, if you are interested in maximizing the effects of sauna, it is clear that a cool off period is important. So it's not that a 15 minute sauna is good, and a 30 minute sauna is better. If you are going to take that route of exploring more, it does seem that doing a 15 minute heating period followed by a five to 10 minute cooling period, and then getting back into the heat can be beneficial. And this is interesting. It gets to the mechanisms by which the hypothalamus areas, the areas of the hypothalamus, that is, that generate increases in body heat, the activation of those neurons occurs as you heat up and then were you to just stay in that heated environment, they would actually shut off and some other neurons would be handling the job so to speak. But by getting in and out of the heated environment, you actually force that system to send repeated pulses of these cortisol lowering and white cell stimulating signals to the body. Some of you have probably heard the phrase, \"feed a fever, starve a cold.\" I don't know who first said that. I couldn't find the citation, but we hear this. And we can speculate that the reason that phrase, \"feed a fever, starve a cold\" came to be is because of the adaptive function of fever, that increases in body temperature make it challenging for intruding viruses and bacteria to survive. Even though, of course, highly elevated body temperatures pose a danger to the host organism, to you. Feeding, eating does cause an increase in body temperature through the so-called thermogenic effect of food. So I can understand the logic of feed a fever. It would mean that when you have a fever, it's your body's natural attempt to heat up and kill some invading thing. And by eating, you would further increase your body temperature. Why you would want to starve a cold, I don't know, however. Maybe it's because when your nasal passages are congested, it's uncomfortable to eat or something of that sort. So the feet of fever part makes sense to me, the starve a cold part is still mysterious to me. I couldn't find any logical reason why that would be good. There are communities out there that believe that fasting is a viable way to combat certain types of infection. Fasting, in particular, prolonged fasts, do increase the amount of adrenaline, also called epinephrin, in the brain and body. And as we'll next explain, epinephrin, adrenaline does have a powerful effect on the various inflammatory cytokines and on the immune system in general. So, let's talk about a behavioral protocol that anyone can use; it doesn't involve any equipment, you don't need a sauna, you don't need anything at all, that has been demonstrated in excellent peer reviewed research to enhance the function of the immune system and actually allow people to combat infection in very dramatic ways. Next, I'd like to do an in-depth analysis of a study that has achieved some prominence out there, not just in the scientific literature, but on the internet, because it relates to how particular types of breathing can impact the immune system and the ability to combat infection. The title of this paper is \"Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans.\" This is a paper that was published in PNAS, which is the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA. It's a very prestigious journal. For those of you that know PNAS, you know that there are certain papers published in PNAS, or there used to be that were not peer reviewed. In recent years, I think all of them have moved to peer reviewed papers. So this is a peer reviewed, very high quality study. And I just want to describe the basic contour of the study. I'll explain the findings, and then I want to go in-depth and explain the mechanistic basis for these findings and the protocol that we can all export from these findings. So, here we go. First of all, a couple of terms so that everybody is on the same page. The sympathetic nervous system is one division of our nervous system. It's a set of neurons down the middle of our spinal cord and in our brain that generally lead to a heightened state of arousal and alertness. It's associated with epinephrin release in the brain and adrenaline release in the body. It's the so-called fight or flight system when it's really active, but it's the system that's active when we are wide awake. And we already talked about the innate immune system. That's that first line of defense after the skin barrier, of course, whereby some infection comes into the body and there's this rapid response of increasing inflammation. And that's also about the time that you first feel lousy. So when you start to feel like, \"ugh, I think I've got something. I don't feel right, a headache. I feel nauseous. I'm heating up. I don't feel good.\" That's the innate immune system kicking in. So what they did in this study, and by the way, I should say they, this first author is Kox, K-O-X, last author, last name Pickkers, P-I-C-K-K-E-R-S. What they did was they exposed human subjects to an endotoxin. In other words, they injected people with E. coli, which is a bacteria which makes people, all people feel terrible. Makes you nauseous, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, it's very unpleasant, okay? These people voluntarily signed up for this study. However, some of the subjects in this study performed a behavioral protocol that can best be described as cyclic hyperventilation. My lab works on these types of breathing protocols. This is not work that my lab did, but basically subjects hyperventilate, followed by breath retention, by breath holds, and I'll explain exactly what they did. They also looked at other forms of behavioral protocols, but let's focus on that one. So, they're comparing controls that do just sort of a basic meditation versus people that do this intense breathing followed by some breath holds. I'm just paraphrasing here, in the intervention group, the breathing group, plasma levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, so this is a cytokine that is lowers inflammation, increased after endotoxin administration. And that was triggered by an increase in epinephrin and adrenaline. So, in other words, doing a particular pattern of breathing allowed an anti-inflammatory cytokine to be turned on, whereas that was not the case in the subjects that did not do this particular breathing protocol. And they discovered that levels of proinflammatory TNF-alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, which you should all be familiar with now, as proinflammatory cytokines were lower in the intervention group. Whereas these IL-10 levels that are anti-inflammatory went up. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. So this is an amazing finding, right? These are human subjects. One group of subjects is doing this breathing protocol. The other group of subjects is just meditating. Both sets of subjects have been injected with E. coli. So, you know everyone's getting the same amount placed into their system. This is very, very interesting. And it leads to the question that every good scientist, two year old or health information seeker asks, which is why? How? How in the world does this work? Why does this work? Well to make a long story shortish, because I am going to go into depth here, the reason it works is because the sympathetic nervous system, the so-called stress part of our nervous system, it's not really called that, but the part of our nervous system that triggers stress from mild stress, to severe stress, even to panic, causes the release of adrenaline and epinephrin in the brain and body. And under normal circumstances, when we have some sort of invading infection, our body is able to push back on that, to resist it by engaging the stress response. So what's happening here is there's a behavioral protocol involving the nervous system, 'cause all behaviors are generated from the nervous system of course. A behavioral protocol that people are deliberately employing that allows them to activate the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn allows them to activate the normal pathways by which immune system function is enhanced. Okay? Now, the reason I'm underscoring this is that the common interpretation of this study is that somehow it blocks the normal immune response, but that's not really what's happening here. Yes, there's a reduction in inflammatory cytokines and there's an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, but that's not really the same thing as blocking the immune response. This could just as easily be viewed as enhancing the immune response and combating the intruder, in this case, E. coli. So, let's parse this study a little bit more closely. First of all, what is this magical pattern of breathing? Some of you may recognize this as so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim, of course the Dutchman. I think his occupation online used to be listed as daredevil, believe it or not, on Wikipedia. That's a pretty cool occupation. Wim is best known for his activities with cold exposure, he holds multiple world records for that, swimming under icebergs and other incredible feats, that you definitely don't want to try unless you're extremely skilled and really know what you're doing, as he does, but also for the use of breath work. The breathing that is so-called Wim Hof breathing is very similar, not exactly the same, but very similar to Tummo breathing, as it's been described historically. In the science and physiology community and in my laboratory, 'cause I run a university laboratory, we refer to it as cyclic hyperventilation, which just means repeated deep breaths in and out. And then there are these retentions. So, because I'm here in the hot seat anyway, I might as well demonstrate it for you so you know what this looks like. There are variations on this, so with respect to Wim, with respect to Tummo practitioners, with respect to the cyclic hyperventilators everywhere, this is one general theme of it. It involves 20 to 30 deep inhales and then exhales through the mouth, followed by a exhale of all one's air and a breath hold, that's the retention. And then at some point, 15 to 60 seconds later, repeating the 25 or 30 breaths. And then again, a breath hold with lungs empty. There are variations on this, but in our laboratory and in this particular study, it looks something like this. Okay, I'm not going to do the whole thing right now, but it goes something like this. [Andrew deeply breathing] Okay, so let's assume I did that for 30 breaths. I can already feel myself perspiring a little bit. You're heating up, that's the release of adrenaline. It's caused by that breathing pattern, and then exhaling all of one's air, no speaking in between like I'm doing. [Andrew deeply exhaling] And then sitting lungs empty until one feels the impulse to breathe and then repeating for several rounds, two or three or even four rounds. Now some people will also introduce a big inhale and breath hold at the end and find that indeed they can hold their breath much longer than they normally would be able to. Because the trigger to breathe is normally activated by increases in carbon dioxide in our blood. We have neurons in our brain stem and in our various regions of our brain, actually, that respond to when carbon dioxide is too high and trigger the reflex to breathe. But when we exhale deeply, we blow off a lot of carbon dioxide so we don't feel that impulse to breathe come quite as soon. Basically this study looked at people doing these cyclic hyperventilation with retention, 25 or 30 breaths, then the retention, 25 or 30 breaths, then retention, 25 or 30 breaths, then the retention. So, three rounds of 25 to 30 breaths followed by exhale, hold in between of various duration. But in general, 15 to 60 seconds is typical. What happened physiologically? This is one of the reasons I like this study. What happened physiologically? Well, a couple of things. Of course, blood oxygenation drops. You would expect that based on hyperventilation and especially based on the exhale of so much carbon dioxide. We could explain why that is, but blood levels of oxygen drop. The pH, the alkalinity of the body goes way up. This is very interesting. If you look up this paper, you can look at Figure One, Panel C, the pH goes way up. People become alkaline. You've heard before of alkaline water. I hate to say this, I'll probably lose some friends for this, but yeah, don't waste your money on drinking alkaline water. You can't really shift the alkalinity of your body. There are cases where some compartment in your body needs to be more alkaline than the rest. Your gut is a different alkalinity than other areas of your body, et cetera, but ingesting high alkaline water isn't going to shift your overall alkalinity. If someone can send me a quality reference that shows different than I'm happy to revise that statement. But in any case, doing that pattern of breathing that I just described greatly increases the pH. Greatly, I should say, it doesn't send it off into dangerous levels. It takes it from 7.4 to 7.6, which is a significant increase in alkalinity. So, as pH levels, for those you remember high school or college chemistry, as the numbers on the pH go down, you're becoming more acidic, as they go up, you're becoming more alkaline, okay or more basic. So, these subjects went from 7.4 to 7.6 during the breathing, and then afterwards it returned to normal. But that shift in alkalinity is thought to be important here. So, what's going on here? How is the breathing leading to the shifts in... Or I should say reduction in inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the liberation of these anti-inflammatory cytokines. Well, the authors make some good arguments as to why it's not the shift in pH per se, or the shift in carbon dioxide levels in the blood, but rather it's the release of epinephrin. And there's some good reason to believe why that's the case. It's beyond the scope of this discussion, but that it's actually the release of epinephrin, AKA adrenaline, that's causing this reduction in inflammation. And that's actually supported by something that you've probably experienced before, which is if you've ever worked, worked, worked, worked, worked really hard, or you've been a caretaker for somebody else or studying for exams, and people around you are getting sick and you're just powering through it and you're not getting sick, but then you stop, you turn in your final exam, you stopped taking care of somebody else, or you finally stop and rest or you go on vacation, and then you get sick. Well, you've just experienced the effect that adrenaline, epinephrin can have in activating your immune system by way of the nervous system, in order to keep fighting and combating infection. And that brings us to a larger theme, which is that stress and combating infection or a wound is not one unique system. It's the same stress system that you use to combat psychological stress. So when you're very, very stressed, at least in the short term, because you release so much adrenaline and epinephrin, you're actually better able to combat infections and you reduce inflammation and the whole feeling lousy response, right? Remember reduced flu-like symptoms here. So this pattern of breathing is actually a very useful tool. And I confess, I use this pattern of breathing anytime I am at the initial stages of getting some sort of bug. If I feel like I've been running myself ragged, or if I somehow, for whatever reason, have a tickle in my throat, or I have that kind of sensation in my nose, like I might've caught a bug of some sort, I will do this pattern of breathing. I've been doing it consistently, gosh, for the last four years or more. Now this is just anecdotal reports, but I find that it allows me indeed to either have those early symptoms disappear, or it allows me to just kind of push through and harder, longer. I don't suggest people continue to push through exposure to infections. Obviously you don't want to infect other people, nor do you want to crash and suddenly get a massive illness of some sort because you stopped doing this breathing. But I do think it's a useful tool. It's a purely behavioral intervention that has been shown here and now there are additional studies on the way, to enhance the function of your immune system and to reduce inflammation. And this is to me, one of the most concrete examples of a zero cost tool that bridges the activation of the nervous system through breathing with the immune system by way of releasing adrenaline and thereby reducing the terrible effects or feelings of lousiness from, in this case, an E. coli infection. Now, I'd like to focus on a couple of important points that I haven't heard discussed broadly elsewhere, which is that the hyperventilation and the breath retention are both important. So you can't simply hyperventilate to get this effect at the level of epinephrin release and reduction in inflammatory cytokines. It's been shown before that the hyperventilation phase and the hypoxia, which is a low oxygen saturation due to the breath retention, they both combine to increase epinephrin adrenaline levels. So, you have to do the 25 or 30 breaths, and then the retention. 25 or 30 breaths then the retention, meaning that the exhale with the breath hold, in order to get the full effect. I'd also want to provide a critical cautionary note. Don't do this anywhere near water or while driving a car. These things might seem kind of obvious, but obviously in the off chance that you black out or something like that, it could be disastrous. So, please be careful. And again, don't try and push the breath hold. The moment you feel the impulse to breathe, just breathe. And it did seem that the three rounds of 25 to 30 breaths with breath hold retentions in between was the ideal protocol. There's one last very interesting feature of this study that I want to emphasize. And that was that they actually measured the so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines are things like dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. These are chemicals in your nervous system and body that promote states of alertness, dopamine, of course, part of the reward and motivation pathways. They explored the levels of these molecules in blood, in plasma during and after this breathing protocol. And it was interesting, as I mentioned before, epinephrin showed robust increases compared to the control group, norepinephrine, significant increases occurred in the breathing group, in the cyclic hyperventilation retention breathing group, of course, but less so. And dopamine levels actually dropped somewhat. But this is very interesting because there's a new and emerging literature largely from Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab in Israel. What her laboratory has shown is that motivational state and mindset has a powerful impact on various aspects of the immune system that were thought to be independent of the brain and mind and thinking. So this brings us back to something that we discussed at the very beginning of this episode, which is that 20, 30 years ago, the idea that you could heal the body with the mind was considered kind of quackery. I think that there was an intervening period up until now where people might've said, \"sure, if you're stressed out, it's going to make things worse.\" I mean, I think everyone agrees that stress makes every thing worse at some level, outcomes to neurodegeneration, performance in a physical endeavors and mental endeavors. If stress is too high for too long people experience different challenges and essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, but in the short term, stress can actually be beneficial in the ways that we just described. And stress, if we break it down is really a neurochemical state, right? It's the release of these catacholamines. And what Asya Rolls' laboratory has shown is that when the so-called dopamine system and at several episodes, I described there are multiple dopamine systems, but the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like the nucleus accumbens, et cetera. When the reward system that's associated with dopamine and norepinephrine is activated, you see incredible effects, including for instance, highly significant reduction in tumor size in cancers. Now, why would that be? How is it that mindset, dopamine and tumors, and tumor growth are somehow linked? We now know how this occurs largely through the incredible work of Asya Rolls and others. So, now I'd like to turn our focus to how it is specifically that certain mindsets impact the immune system in ways that we can actually point to specific biological pathways and also specific protocols related to mindset. I guess a simple way to frame all this would be to say that most of us are aware that yes, indeed, you can worry yourself sick. We've been told that, you're going to worry yourself sick. And actually there was a paper published in \"Science,\" again, one of the top three journals out there, the top three really being \"Nature,\" \"Science,\" and \"Cell.\" And then other of course, excellent journals exist, but this was a paper that came out in \"Science\" last year. First author is Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A, describing psychogenic stress and fever. So this was looking or asking the question, are there areas of the brain that actually underlie this notion that we can worry ourselves sick? And they discovered a new pathway and they were able to both activate this pathway independent of worry and stress and see illness occur, and they were able to inhibit this pathway, block activity in this neural pathway and prevent psychogenic fever and the worrying of oneself sick. So, they were able to do this in a very controlled way. I'll just mention the pathway in case you want to look it up in more detail. This is a corticolimbic pathway. So, just to orient us, the cortex is more or less the outer shell of the brain. It's involved in thinking and sensation and perceptions and learning and maintenance of a lot of memories are stored there. We all hear that you learn and remember in the hippocampus, that's the initial site of learning and memory, but then that information, believe it or not, is passed off to the cortex where it's stored in kind of a long-term hard drive type storage. So the corticolimbic pathway is one in which your thoughts, your prior experiences can literally in a structure way, feed down onto the areas of the brain that control very basal processes, including temperature regulation. So this is a corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway. We talked earlier about the hypothalamus as controlling temperature and a lot of sickness related behavior, right? Remember vagus up to the hypothalamus and all the sleep more, less appetite, fever. Okay, that's all in the hypothalamus. This is a top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway, and it has a fancy name. It's the dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta. The short of that is the DP/DTT. Let's just call it the DP/DTT, to the dorsomedial hypothalamus. A lot of D's. It shouldn't mean anything. It doesn't really matter what we call it. But what's important is conceptually it's a pathway that originates insights to the brain that are associated with thinking, with emotion and with prior history, and feeds directly into an area of the brain that's involved in basic physiological subconsciously controlled processes. So, that's incredible, right? And it points to a physical pathway by which the way we think about something changes something core about our physiology. Now, in some ways that shouldn't be surprising, right? If you think about something that excites you, your heart rate can increase. You think about something that terrifies you, your heart rate can increase. So the idea that thinking controls our physiology is not a new concept at all, but somehow human beings, we have been challenged with the idea that we could actually think ourselves into being sick. But this paper from Kataoka shows that if you expose somebody to a psychological stress, you can actually activate this pathway and create a fever. And how do they do that? Well, you can do this by exposing subjects to a very stressful real event, and you cue it through our associative learning. So, maybe, like my PILOT V5s, which I love so much, we could traumatize me to the PILOT V5 if I had some horrible experience happen to me while I'm looking at and concentrating on the PILOT V5. Then you take away the horrible experience, you give me the PILOT V5, and I start to experience a lot of the symptoms associated with that terrible event. They were able to do this using sickness inducing stimuli and so forth. They did all the various derivations and identified this pathway that when activated, even in the absence of some horrible event, could create fever and illness-like behavior and so forth. And if they blocked certain stations along this neural pathway, they could block that effect. So this is really concrete evidence, proof, if you will, that there are dedicated pathways in the mammalian brain, your brain and mine, that allow us to turn thoughts into illness. That's kind of a depressing idea. What about the inverse? What about turning thoughts into health? Well, that's the work of Asya Rolls. They explored the well-established psychological phenomenon that when cancer patients or very ill people or people who are suffering from very debilitating injuries, when people had a reported a sense of hope, their rates of recovery were much higher, right? Sounds very subjective. But what is a sense of hope? A sense of hope is a sense of the future. A sense of the future is tightly associated with the dopamine system. Dopamine, again, being this molecule of reward and motivation and movement, but movement and motivation are about things that are beyond the confines of our skin and are about the future. And so what they've discovered and through other studies from other groups have discovered is that stimulation of the dopamine pathway, either simply by thinking about a future, ideally a positive future, but thinking about a positive future leads to activation of the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway and could reduce the size of tumors, could accelerate wound healing, could greatly accelerate the passage from a state of illness to a state of health and wellbeing. So there are many, many studies now starting to wick out related to this. There's also the idea that augmenting the dopamine system can increase the rate of healing. And so, there are individuals out there who opt, for instance, to take things that increase dopamine. Now, obviously drugs of abuse would not be a good idea in this context, even though they increase dopamine, they lead to big crashes, they have addictive properties, et cetera. I've talked before on this podcast about things like L-tyrosine, taking anywhere from 500 to 750 milligrams can increase dopamine because tyrosine is a dopamine precursor, of course. Things like Mucuna pruriens, which are L-dopa, the immediate precursor to dopamine. Some of these will lead to somewhat of a crash in certain individuals. Other people tolerate them a little bit better. Again, you have to talk to your doctor, you have to figure out what's right for you. If you have bipolar or mania or schizophrenia, these things, I would not recommend them at all. I'm not recommending them at all, I'm just mentioning them for potential exploration if it's safe and right for you. But the point is this: the dopamine system, when activated can accelerate healing, it can accelerate the recovery from injury of all kinds. And that shouldn't come as a mystery or surprise result to us. It's because this reward pathway and the fact that it's related to a sense of the future seems to liberate entire systems within the body that make inflammatory cytokines go down, and anti-inflammatory cytokines go up. Exactly as was demonstrated in the beautiful PNAS study where breathing, cyclic hyperventilation, was used to increase epinephrin, increase norepinephrine, and to augment the catecholamine system. So, I think that the bridges between these studies are really relevant. In one case, I'm talking about potentially taking an over-the-counter compound to increase dopamine to accelerate healing. In another case, we're talking about using breathing. There's also the use of cold water exposure to increase dopamine. I talked about this several episodes ago, but it's been shown that immersing oneself in cold water up to the neck or so. How cold? Well, it depends on what you can tolerate, but uncomfortably cold, but not so cold that you become hypothermic, but where it's challenging to get in, but you can stay there for three to 10 minutes or so, has been shown to lead to very significant, up to doubling or more of baseline dopamine levels and epinephrin levels that go on for several hours. This may be the basis for why people will do cold showers or ice baths and then get into a sauna. So, what's called cold-heat contrast therapy, as a way to augment these neurotransmitters. Today, we've been talking about how these neurotransmitters can be used to enhance the function of the immune system. And so just keep in mind that anytime you're talking about increasing neurotransmitter levels, that can be done pharmacologically through supplementation, or the can be done behaviorally through exposure to cold water, for instance, or it can be done even just simply by breathing in a particular way, cyclic hyperventilation followed by retention. The catacholamines, noradrenaline, dopamine, and norepinephrine are the bridge of activation for the immune system and the nervous system. They are the way that the nervous system calls out to the immune system, \"Aha, we have a problem. We need to counter this.\" So you can think of them, them meaning dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, as being able to deploy larger amounts of immune cells, all the types of immune cells that we talked about at the beginning of the episode. Okay, so thus far, we've been discussing how one can prevent getting sick or when one starts to feel ill, how one might be able to shorten the course of that infection by ramping up the activity of the immune system. But what about when you're already experiencing symptoms? The runny nose, stuffed up nose, congestion, headache, et cetera. Well, there are many ways to address that at the symptom level. You're probably aware of all the over the counter medications, many of which focus on the epinephrin system. Things that are of the Sudafed variety prevent or reduce congestion because of the way that they cause release of epinephrin, and some of the effects on dilating the bronchioles and dilating the nasal passages and so forth. I'm not going to speak to whether or not those are good or bad choices. They do have a couple of effects that are not so great for the course of treating the underlying cause, which are first of all they can cause dehydration. So you have to make sure that you're hydrating well, both fluids and electrolytes, and they also can interfere with sleep because as I've talked about in the episodes on sleep, one of the hallmarks of deep sleep and in particular REM sleep is that epinephrin, adrenaline levels are low. This is what allows you to have intense, often very emotionally-laden dreams during REM sleep and not act those out. And low adrenaline, epinephrin during REM sleep is basically a signature, a neurochemical signature of the REM sleep state, which is so vital for emotional and physical repair and so forth. So, the fact that they can inhibit sleep, the fact that can cause dehydration, the fact that they can make people feel kind of lightheaded and jittery makes them not terrific choices for a number of people. There is an interesting alternative choice. And when I say alternative, I do mean alternative. The choice that I'm referring to is spirulina, which is actually a form of algae. Years ago, I think when I first heard about spirulina, it sounded very much of the kind of 1970s, 80s health food store variety. It seemed really kind of mystical and wacky, but actually now there are some really nice studies and some data, and also an understanding of the mechanism by which spirulina can have potent effects in reducing what's called rhinitis, which is a fancy word for congestion of the nose and an inflammation of the nose. Basically, anytime you hear a word that includes \"itis,\" at least if it's in the medical or health context, it generally means inflammation of some tissue. So rhinitis just being inflammation of the nasal passages, but that's one of the most uncomfortable symptoms of any kind of infection. So there are two studies I'd like to highlight just very quickly. One is the effects of spirulina on allergic rhinitis. And the other is a clinical comparison to the efficacy of spirulina platensis, that's a technical name, and cetirizine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. These looked at humans, so this is not a mouse study, this is a study on humans. Both sexes, so males and females. In one case, looking at 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects. The other, 65 subjects, so decent number of subjects, randomized trial, double blind. Both cases saw significant decreases in nasal obstruction, improved ability to smell, improved sleep, daily working inflammatory cytokines were reduced as well, reduction in nasal itching, all the stuff that you'd like to experience, I can imagine, after taking two grams, two grams, not milligrams, but two grams of spirulina. Sometimes had to be taken for a short while before the effect kicked in. So, that's pretty impressive, I would say, but it doesn't really speak to mechanism, but in exploring the underlying mechanisms for spirulina's effects on reducing rhinitis, it's interesting to find that spirulina actually can inhibit the formation and/or activity of so-called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells. We haven't talked a lot about mast cells, but they are a very interesting cell type in the immune response. Essentially what they are, are little packets of histamine. And when we have some sort of injury or irritant rather to the skin, so a mosquito bite, for instance, or poison oak or poison ivy, something that causes an itch or something that causes inflammation internally, doesn't just have to be on the skin, these mast are these little bubbles that contain histamine that go to that site [hissing], and release their histaminergic contents and cause swelling and inflammation of whatever cells are affected locally. You might think, well, why would I want to have a mechanism in my body that would cause swelling and inflammation? Ah, well then those cells in turn send out cytokine signals that recruit the very cell types that we were talking about way back at the beginning of the episode, the cells that are characteristics of the innate immune system that come in, the macrophages and the other types of cells that will come in and gobble up the foreign invaders or will help sequester and move away, say the poison from a bite or from whatever irritant. Again, it doesn't just have to be at the skin surface. I'm describing an example of at the skin, for instance, if you've ever had hives of any kind, that almost certainly involved mast cells. So, and when you take an anti-histamine in order to deal with seasonal allergies, for instance, you're taking a compound that's reducing histamines in mast cells. And spirulina has also been used quite effectively as a way to treat seasonal allergies and some of the symptomatology. Equally on par with some of the major prescription and over the counter drugs for that. One cautionary note, spirulina can carry some side effects for people that have a genetic mutation leading to something called PKU. These people know who they are. They're very sensitive to phenylalanine. These same people cannot drink any sort of NutraSweet or diet soda for reasons that they understand. It can be quite dangerous. It's a rare genetic disorder, but nonetheless, spirulina can be an issue for those people. For most people, the side effect profile is pretty minimal. And just to be clear, I don't have any relationship to spirulina company or anything. I just find it interesting that there are these compounds that sound rather, forgive the phrase, but rather new-agey because they come from a algae, from a plant. But when you look at the underlying mechanism, it makes perfect sense. So that's often what we like to point out here is that if there are these so-called alternative therapies, alternative because most people haven't heard of them, it's always nice if they map to a specific logical mechanism and framework by which that compound would work, as opposed to just some anecdote of, \"Oh, I hear spirulina is great for allergies.\" Well, now we know why, it inhibits mast cells and histaminergic mast cells in particular. Earlier, I mentioned a new and very exciting study published as a full article in \"Nature.\" Full article means that it is a major finding. At the journal, \"Nature,\" they have letters, which are important findings. They're still very high stringency for getting a letter in \"Nature\" published. But the full articles, generally there's only one or two per issue in the weekly edition of \"Nature.\" And just last week, there was a very exciting article published from Qiufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School. Qiufu I've known for a number of years. His group has done phenomenal work on the mechanisms of itch and pain and discovering some of the receptors and pathways for itch and pain. And more recently they've been exploring the mechanistic basis of acupuncture. And the title of the article is, \"A neuroanatomical basis for electroacupuncture to drive the vagal adrenal axis.\" And while that's a mouthful, now most all of you are probably familiar with what I mean when I say vagal adrenal axis; vagal meaning of the vagus, and adrenal of the adrenal glands. And so perhaps we should not be surprised, although excited, nonetheless, that when Qiufu's lab looked at stimulation of the body with so-called electroacupuncture. So, these are needles where a small bit of electrical current, low level of electrical current, is passed into the needle and therefore into the body. They located sites on the body that can increase inflammation by way of releasing inflammatory cytokines. These areas included the abdomen, and they found areas on the body such as the lower limbs, or the hind limbs in this case, that can stimulate the vagal adrenal reflex and can lead to reduced inflammation. And what was really interesting is that they figured out that it was activation of nerve endings that resided in the fascia. I mentioned earlier what fascia is, but just to remind you, the fascia is a really thick sheath of tissue that surrounds muscle. If ever you've heard of Rolfing, Rolfing is a form of very intense massage. I've never had this done, but I've heard about this. It involves among other things, actually separating the muscle away from the fascia somewhat. So it's a very, very deep tissue massage. Actually a good friend of mine who had this done told me that it was probably the most challenging physical experience that he had ever been through going through this Rolfing procedure. Maybe some of you have have been Rolfed, as they say, and can report to the experience, whether or not it was pleasant or unpleasant, or you felt benefits or not. In any case, this study isn't about Rolfing per se, but it is about the fascia. And so what they discovered is there's a specific population of neurons. Those neurons have a name, as they often do in science. Name isn't important, but if you want to look it up, it's the PROKR2 neurons, P-R-O-K R2 neurons. And they send a connection deep into the limb fascial tissue, okay? And then they send another connection, the connections we're referring to are axons, neurons have axons. So a wire in one direction that goes into the deep fascial tissue of the lower limb, near the calf and thigh. And then they send another wire up into the spinal cord, into a region of the hind brain in the back of your brain kind of near your neck in the medulla oblongata, that neuron also has a name called the DMZ, doesn't matter. And that neuron connects to the adrenal gland to release our good old friends, the catacholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine, or norepinephrine, epinephrin, and dopamine. And their release causes a reduction in inflammation, even in response to an injection of something called lipopolysaccharide, which can actually induce fever. So, what does all this saying? This is saying that activation of the deep fascial tissue causes a chain of neural reactions that leads eventually to the release of norepinephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine. And once again, lowers inflammation, very much like the breathing study that we talked about earlier in the pattern of cyclical hyperventilation with retention, leading to reductions in inflammation. I can't tell you how happy this makes me. I had nothing to do with this work, but the reason it makes me happy is because I have a particular fondness for when practices that have existed for many centuries or even thousands of years, such as acupuncture, such as respiration work, start to converge with some of the hardcore mechanistic science. And the reason this excites me is not because we want to take science and erase the previous tools and methods of these ancient practices, not at all. And it certainly isn't the case that we just want to name things or rename things with modern science. What's very exciting is when we can discover mechanism that explains why certain practices work. First of all, that validates those as legitimate practices, maybe even insurance will start to cover them, whereas maybe they previously had not, I don't know what the current status is for insurance coverage of acupuncture. I'm guessing there are places that do it, maybe others that don't. I personally am not somebody who receives acupuncture. I have in the past, but it's not that I'm in particular a fan of it, but I think that there are a number of people that have benefited from it. So, I think that's wonderful. Breath work and respiration work is something that I've cultivated as a practice over the years. I mentioned earlier, how I use it to push back on incoming infections and so forth. And now that doesn't sound like total... You know, like just a figment of my imagination, there's actually a mechanism, a published mechanism to explain it. But the most exciting thing to me about all this is that practices that traditionally have been shrouded in complicated language or were the unique domain of the practitioners and relied on phrases like the meridians or the chakras, of which I think is perfectly valid language, but doesn't inform mechanism. And then in a separate community, the community I come from, the community of scientists, have used language like PROKR2 neurons, medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis. And basically no one can communicate with one another because the language is shrouding. What we're now starting to see is that at their convergence is a common mechanism. And with that understanding, what's going to be really terrific is as new protocols start to emerge. So in understanding mechanisms and pathways, and in being able to understand the base set of practices like breathing, like electroacupuncture, and so forth, we can now start to daydream in a very realistic way about the development of new protocols, more effective protocols. Protocols that perhaps one can do at home without needles, perhaps protocols such as the breathing that you can do anywhere, anytime, and be confident that you're actually impacting the IL-6 and the IL-8 pathways, reducing those and increasing IL-10. So we are no longer wandering around in the fog hearing about these magical techniques without understanding why they work, nor are we just seeing a bunch of science that is descriptive, but not mechanistic or pointing to specific protocols. So, I'm just delighted. Again, I had nothing to do with this work, but really terrific work, Qiufu and colleagues. And I also want to acknowledge a journal as prominent as \"Nature\" for featuring this upfront, because I think it really does mark the beginning of a new path in medicine. And just to underscore that point a little bit further, the National Institutes of Health, of course has a cancer institute, an eye institute, that deal with trying to combat cancer and to cure blindness and so forth. And now they have what's called NCCIH, which has complimentary health. And so, there are good tax dollars being put to the kinds of explorations that we're talking about that undoubtedly are going to lead to better treatments for immunological diseases, neurological diseases, the convergence of the immune system and the nervous system. Very exciting times and I hope that by learning about some of this new and emerging science and hearing about some of the protocols that are either zero cost or low cost, certainly for respiration that's the case or for the use of heat or cold, or maybe even electroacupuncture if you have access to that, that we can really see that we're starting to evolve as a field of health and medicine and science and ancient practices, and that they're really starting to converge and have a vector, as we say, in a new and more exciting direction. Once again, we've covered a lot of information today. We learned about the immune system, the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system, and the nervous system and how those interact. And throughout, we discussed protocols that can allow you to tap into this relationship between the nervous system and immune system, and hopefully avoid and/or shorten the course of any illnesses, injuries, or inflammation that you might encounter.

    "summary": "The immune system is the body's first line of defense against infection. It is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to identify and eliminate foreign substances. The nervous system plays a key role in the function of the immune system. It is responsible for the activation and regulation of the immune system. The nervous system can be used to activate and control the immune system. This can be done through the use of acupuncture, breathing exercises, and lifestyle changes.\nThe immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that protect us from infection and disease. The nervous system and immune system interact in a variety of ways, including the production of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules. This process can be modulated by the nervous system through the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. The Huberman Lab Podcast discusses the relationship between the nervous system and the immune system, and how this relationship can be harnessed to improve health and wellbeing.\n",
